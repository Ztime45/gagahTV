00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:41.973
Oh no!

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:43.736
You're out of tune.
Completely out of tune.

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.710
-What's up, Maestro?
-A lifeless voice can't sing in tune.

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:49.870
Sounds like she has a sore throat.

00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:54.094
-What's wrong, Kiran?
-She needn't say. I know it all.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.707
All these girls do nowadays is to
roam till late at nights with friends.

00:03:57.954 --> 00:03:59.144
She has shouted her voice hoarse.

00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:02.214
And they'll eat whatever they like.
Is that a sign of love for music?

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:06.457
-That's going to get you nowhere.
-Please do not say so, maestro.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:10.211
Tell us Kiran, d'you or don't you
want to master classical music?

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:13.850
You must devote yourself
completely to your lessons.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:20.588
I'll be back after a few days.
Get over the sore throat by then.

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:23.602
Greetings, Sir.

00:04:26.073 --> 00:04:30.226
-Does he have a problem with me?
-Never mind the daily dramatics.

00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:32.667
Have you got the tickets
to the New Year's party?

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:09.800
A pack of biscuits and a
bread. Need anything more?

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.747
-No thanks. How much was that?
-Fifteen bucks.

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:18.170
Rohit Kumar, your neighbor upstairs,
screams his head off all day.

00:11:18.287 --> 00:11:21.920
-Aren't your ears sore already?
-That's him rehearsing music.

00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.869
And he loves music. Besides,
I am not irked to complain.

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:28.035
For God's sake!

00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:33.505
How come you're so busy with your
accounts so early in the morning?

00:11:33.672 --> 00:11:36.795
Won't you sit down to a cuppa?
-Woe beside!

00:11:37.271 --> 00:11:40.061
Rohit Kumar hasn't
paid me in 3 months now.

00:11:40.607 --> 00:11:42.352
He gets me to make him new
dresses every now and then.

00:11:42.483 --> 00:11:44.555
But just doesn't bother
to pay for the stitching.

00:11:44.693 --> 00:11:48.029
He owes me a large sum too.
But I just can't complain.

00:11:49.707 --> 00:11:52.388
Hey Kanhaiya! Come
over for a cup of tea.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.824
Give it a rev.

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.022
It's all your fault.

00:12:01.672 --> 00:12:03.890
You've given the house to a
tuppence worth of a singer on rent.

00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:06.260
All you have for yourself
is a room in the backyard.

00:12:07.281 --> 00:12:08.891
Has he paid the rents yet?

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.800
He'll pay up in due
course. Fine fellow.

00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:14.252
How are you, Rohit?

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:17.267
-Hello, good morning.
-Good morning.

00:12:17.388 --> 00:12:19.115
-Come over here, Qasim.
-In a moment.

00:12:19.591 --> 00:12:21.112
-I'm ravenous.
-What can I get you?

00:12:21.192 --> 00:12:25.557
-2 fried eggs, buttered toasts, jam,
a special cup of tea. -Coming up.

00:12:25.857 --> 00:12:27.481
Mister Rohit kumar.

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:30.033
Hello, Mr. Jamshed. How d'you do?

00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:32.222
Forget niceties. Talk cash.

00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:34.045
Some bills are due
for a couple of months.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.743
Today's the first of the month.
I'll settle your account on 30th.

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.835
Very well... er... what
did you say? By the 30th?

00:12:38.922 --> 00:12:42.631
-Exactly. How many days between
the 30th and the first? -One day.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.287
-He's making a fool out of Jamshed.
-That's right.

00:12:48.526 --> 00:12:52.309
Didn't you have a show
last night? How did it go?

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:56.674
-It was a riot! -Was it then?!
-The crowd went berserk as I sang.

00:12:56.754 --> 00:13:00.487
And the girls were crazy about me.

00:13:02.585 --> 00:13:05.122
There was this girl
who caught my eye.

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:08.109
She has beautiful
eyes and a pretty face.

00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:12.499
-Fabulous! What happened later?
-She left after the program ended.

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:18.081
If she comes into my life, I'll
write the best songs on earth.

00:13:18.201 --> 00:13:22.754
Dream you may. But everyone
cannot become Elvis.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.657
Shut up Moolchand. You're a grocer.
What d'you know about music?

00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:32.743
Someday Rohit Kumar will make the
greatest singer in our country.

00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:35.190
-Cheers.
-Cheers... cheers.

00:13:49.675 --> 00:13:51.098
No one even bothers to listen.

00:13:56.128 --> 00:14:00.070
Look... it's Mehra. He's counting
the proceeds of the show last night.

00:14:00.443 --> 00:14:04.206
-He made 50 to 60,000 last night.
-And we don't get a penny of it.

00:14:10.607 --> 00:14:12.313
Happy New Year, Mr. Mehra.

00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:17.910
What's so special about a New Year?
Just another day and another night.

00:14:18.378 --> 00:14:20.602
Oh yes. But it was a grand
show last night, wasn't it?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.260
-Well, average, I'd say.
-Average, d'you say? -About that.

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:26.196
-There! Look at the pile you made
last night. -What are you up to?

00:14:26.873 --> 00:14:32.893
It's all because of me, Sir.
People come here to hear me sing.

00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:38.162
That's how you sake in the moolah.
D'you take yourself for a star...

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:40.050
...just because I've put up
a couple of your portraits?

00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:42.868
-You see, Sir. I am...
-You should be grateful to me!

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:47.027
Grateful for letting you sing
before such a large gathering!

00:14:47.193 --> 00:14:51.122
Minstrels like you roam
the streets a dime-a-dozen.

00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:53.017
And no one would even
care to give you tuppence.

00:14:53.098 --> 00:14:54.425
You ingrate!

00:14:54.964 --> 00:14:56.064
-Hii. -What?

00:15:00.742 --> 00:15:04.696
How dare you misbehave! You come
here to sing. Not to chase girls!

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:07.284
I'm not chasing her,
Sir. I was just...

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.841
-I'd like to learn how to sing
from you. -From me?

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:25.768
And, you wrote such a beautiful
song. I'm crazy about your song.

00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:28.556
I can't think of anything else.

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:34.493
I couldn't sleep last night after
your show. I kept humming the tune.

00:15:37.739 --> 00:15:40.978
-Neither did I sleep after the
show last night. -Why?

00:15:42.132 --> 00:15:44.510
It is a new tune that
kept me up all the night.

00:15:46.022 --> 00:15:46.625
Would you like to hear it?

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:47.705
Of course.

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:49.359
Hold this.

00:16:51.558 --> 00:16:53.439
Fantastic. Wonderful.

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.129
Such a beautiful song!

00:16:55.266 --> 00:16:56.266
So romantic.

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:59.176
Songs like that are what I'd
like to sing. Not the classicals.

00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:01.240
Please teach me how to
sing a song like that.

00:17:01.592 --> 00:17:02.912
I'll work hard at it.

00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:04.923
-No problem.
-Great.

00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:48.337
"The king fell in
love with the queen;"

00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:53.313
"From the very first glance
sprang his very first love."

00:17:54.245 --> 00:17:58.622
"The hearts of both were wounded

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.025
by an arrowed glance that
breached the hearts' walls."

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:08.638
"The king fell in
love with the queen...

00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:13.497
from the very first glance
sprang his very first love."

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.726
"The hearts of both were wounded

00:18:19.172 --> 00:18:24.040
by an arrowed glance that
breached the hearts' walls."

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:28.804
"The king fell in
love with the queen..."

00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:33.781
"The king fell in
love with the queen..."

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:11.293
"Yet in finding the path,
in discovering an embrace,

00:19:11.877 --> 00:19:15.609
neither their path nor
their embrace is assured."

00:19:15.962 --> 00:19:21.281
"This often happens;
the buds of desire,

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:25.936
blossoming, do not flower."

00:19:26.016 --> 00:19:31.871
"Even so,
who knows why it did not obey..."

00:19:32.112 --> 00:19:36.523
"Even so,
who knows why it did not obey...

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:42.002
the mad heart grew
uncontrollably restless."

00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:46.528
"The king fell in
love with the queen;"

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:51.515
"The king fell in
love with the queen;"

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.323
"To Look at the queen;
meeting her gaze,

00:20:47.403 --> 00:20:50.926
she hid her eyes (for shame)."

00:20:51.387 --> 00:20:57.044
"What else could she do;
bowing her head,

00:20:57.331 --> 00:21:01.206
her bangles began to twirl."

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:07.190
"Such was the spell
that the king cast..."

00:21:07.338 --> 00:21:12.002
"Such was the spell
that the king cast...

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.263
even as she demurred,
she consented."

00:21:17.407 --> 00:21:21.846
"The king fell in
love with the queen;"

00:21:22.517 --> 00:21:26.735
"From the very first glance
sprang his very first love."

00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:32.013
"The hearts of both were wounded

00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:36.773
by an arrowed glance that
breached the hearts' walls."

00:21:53.122 --> 00:21:54.704
Why don't we get married, Kiran?

00:21:56.186 --> 00:21:57.186
What?!

00:21:58.134 --> 00:21:59.134
I'm serious.

00:22:03.053 --> 00:22:04.815
I've never thought about it.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:11.015
-I've only think about one thing.
-What?

00:22:12.811 --> 00:22:14.597
Music and my career.

00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:19.114
I want to make the
greatest singer of the land.

00:22:21.728 --> 00:22:24.013
-That'll be difficult.
-Why?

00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:27.665
Because that status has been
booked for me a long while ago.

00:22:30.486 --> 00:22:31.486
Kiran.

00:22:34.761 --> 00:22:38.199
What could be better
for both of us?

00:22:39.493 --> 00:22:42.558
We travel towards same goals. And
we could reach our goal together.

00:22:45.434 --> 00:22:48.058
Tell me... will you marry me?

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:52.144
What brings you here?

00:22:52.344 --> 00:22:54.310
He's a famous singer.

00:22:55.376 --> 00:22:56.376
So you are a singer, are you?

00:22:57.662 --> 00:23:00.516
Actually, I'm a composer.

00:23:01.837 --> 00:23:03.956
I write the songs I sing.

00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:04.919
Classicals?

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:11.079
-Not classicals. I sing lighter tunes.
-How light?

00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:15.027
-I don't think you understand.
-Please help me too.

00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:17.828
I sing songs that strike
a chord in the heart.

00:23:19.572 --> 00:23:20.838
And where do you sing such songs?

00:23:21.918 --> 00:23:24.478
Presently, I sing at a hotel.
-At a hotel?

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.233
One might as well sing at a hotel
as go around with a begging bowl.

00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:34.378
As with wandering minstrels who
collect pence in tips if at all.

00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:37.884
Enough. I have not come
here to discuss my careers.

00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:39.508
So, what brings you here?

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.200
Excuse me, Kiran.

00:23:45.541 --> 00:23:47.831
Stop, Rohit!

00:23:48.863 --> 00:23:50.213
Listen to me...

00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:54.130
Rohit... Please Rohit.

00:23:57.526 --> 00:24:00.896
I didn't invite Rohit
so you might insult him.

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:06.649
D'you take me for a fool? A look at
him and I know why you invited him.

00:24:07.964 --> 00:24:10.617
Stop being foolish. Your
marriage has already been fixed.

00:24:15.415 --> 00:24:19.308
-I'm in love with Rohit.
-Do you hear what she says?

00:24:21.604 --> 00:24:25.342
You must consider the
consequences. This is not done.

00:24:26.015 --> 00:24:29.933
The upbringing and education I've
given her all these years are a waste!

00:24:30.479 --> 00:24:32.983
If you think so highly about my
upbringing and my education...

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.156
...you should respect
my decisions too.

00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:38.985
I have a feeling that he's a
cunning fellow. He's ensnaring you.

00:24:40.069 --> 00:24:42.902
-You're still an innocent girl.
-I'm no innocent, mother.

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.664
And what does that make of you?

00:24:45.507 --> 00:24:47.599
I'm an artist.
And, he's an artist too.

00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:49.744
You can't gauge our sentiments.

00:24:50.673 --> 00:24:51.764
Don't I understand?

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.328
An artist my foot!
A Bremen-town musician!

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.323
A good for nothing vagabond!
And she wants to marry him!

00:24:57.505 --> 00:24:59.347
You'll get to know about the
realities in life in no time!

00:24:59.655 --> 00:25:03.281
Don't you come back crying later on.
Our doors will have closed for you.

00:25:06.893 --> 00:25:12.251
Just as well that you told me all
this. It'll help me take my decision.

00:25:13.715 --> 00:25:15.515
I'm going to marry Rohit.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.578
Kiran... Kir...

00:26:28.657 --> 00:26:29.657
Enough.

00:26:29.997 --> 00:26:33.497
-I'll floor them at the audition today.
-May I accompany you?

00:26:33.577 --> 00:26:35.018
It'll take me 2
minutes to get dressed.

00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:38.586
Isn't the plumber
expected in today?

00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:41.084
See you. Bye.

00:26:48.905 --> 00:26:49.905
Thank you.

00:27:23.134 --> 00:27:25.398
How are you going to climb four
stories in the condition you are?

00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:28.006
But, this is your first recording.
And I wanted to be there with you.

00:27:28.086 --> 00:27:30.765
I'm not recording for a film. Its
just a jingle for an advertisement.

00:27:31.906 --> 00:27:34.460
When am I going to meet the right
people? When will I start working?

00:27:34.937 --> 00:27:37.390
It's just a matter of a few more
months. What makes you so upright?

00:28:23.198 --> 00:28:24.985
-Hello, Farida. Come in.
-What are you doing?

00:28:25.065 --> 00:28:27.096
Nothing much. Just cooking.

00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:29.822
-Like a cup of tea? -Why not?
-Is the tea brewed? -Yes.

00:28:30.989 --> 00:28:32.747
I haven't seen you
around in 4 or 5 days.

00:28:33.471 --> 00:28:35.250
-Have you been keeping well?
-Absolutely.

00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:41.905
-What's the matter? You seem tense.
-Not at all. I'm perfectly fine.

00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:46.927
How are your music
rehearsals going on?

00:28:47.397 --> 00:28:51.231
I hardly find time outside household
chores. How am I to rehearse?

00:28:52.882 --> 00:28:56.939
What of the career in music? Can you
immerse yourself so in the chores?

00:28:58.284 --> 00:29:00.557
You must carve out some
time everyday for rehearsing.

00:29:01.312 --> 00:29:04.945
Look at me... I must fetch Sonu
from school after I finish cooking.

00:29:05.651 --> 00:29:09.966
I'll go and fetch Sonu... Yes.
I will. It doesn't really matter.

00:29:10.274 --> 00:29:11.274
Thanks.

00:29:13.524 --> 00:29:14.524
Hi, Kiran.

00:29:14.718 --> 00:29:16.300
Will you please draw a bath for me?
Make it fast.

00:29:16.394 --> 00:29:17.394
I've to attend a party.

00:29:17.487 --> 00:29:19.954
-What party? -Oh, there's
something I'd like you to know.

00:29:20.582 --> 00:29:24.234
-I've dumped the job.
-Why?

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.843
I had enough of Mehra's abuses.
Besides, I want to move upwards.

00:29:29.589 --> 00:29:34.617
-What's more, I met Gulbadan
Kumar today. -Gulbadan Kumar?

00:29:34.793 --> 00:29:37.922
Yes. He owns Prince Records. Its
really tough to get to meet him.

00:29:38.381 --> 00:29:42.391
I walked into his office and sang
a few songs. He liked my voice.

00:29:42.834 --> 00:29:47.734
He invited me to the party this
evening. Looks like I've made it.

00:29:48.584 --> 00:29:50.067
Just press these clothes for me,
will you?

00:29:50.226 --> 00:29:51.440
I'm coming with you!

00:29:51.718 --> 00:29:52.445
What'll you do there?

00:29:52.525 --> 00:29:54.332
-You'd get bored.
-No. I won't get bored.

00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:57.548
-What about Sonu?
-Farida can put him to sleep.

00:29:58.678 --> 00:30:01.192
All right. You can come along.
Get dressed in some good clothes.

00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:03.042
Now. Take the clothes.
Press them quickly.

00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:10.106
Congratulations, Mr.
Gulbadan Kumar.

00:30:10.261 --> 00:30:14.245
Ever since your company was formed
music sales have grown manifold.

00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:16.186
It's the grace
of The Divine Mother.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.841
A double gold disc
for the music directors.

00:30:21.188 --> 00:30:22.656
Someday I'll get mine too.

00:30:25.502 --> 00:30:28.497
I've recorded my voice
on a cassette... Rohit!

00:30:29.106 --> 00:30:31.254
I've recorded one of
my songs in a cassette.

00:30:31.345 --> 00:30:33.935
Will you please give it
to Gulbadan Kumar?

00:30:34.865 --> 00:30:36.515
All right.

00:30:38.315 --> 00:30:42.666
Hows the good lady? I greet you
in the name of The Divine Mother.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.543
-Hello. -I'm Rohit Kumar.
-Of course, Mr. Rohit Kumar.

00:30:46.631 --> 00:30:49.176
-Greetings!
-Grand party. -It's modest really.

00:30:50.043 --> 00:30:53.858
-Have you listened to my cassette?
-Yes I did. -Did you like it?

00:30:54.545 --> 00:30:56.749
-Very nice.
-Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir.

00:31:00.883 --> 00:31:03.634
Glory be to The Divine Mother!

00:31:04.152 --> 00:31:07.368
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan!
You're raking in gold discs.

00:31:07.596 --> 00:31:08.992
Let's pose for a photograph.

00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:14.273
-You're the biggest of them all.
-Not at all. -Isn't it, now?

00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:19.834
It's the two of you, Messrs Amar &
Kaushik who are the most well known.

00:31:19.955 --> 00:31:25.116
That's the magic of our music.
We've defined 6 super hit films.

00:31:25.314 --> 00:31:27.623
-Our critics are now silenced.
-Indeed. Indeed, Mr. Gulbadan.

00:31:27.716 --> 00:31:30.741
You must listen to the music
we've scored for our next film.

00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:33.531
We recorded a song yesterday.
Beautiful!

00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:37.320
Which film is the song meant for?

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.984
Well... he's an upcoming
artiste. He's also a singer.

00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:44.587
-Mr. Rahul Kumar.
-I'm Rohit Kumar, Sir.

00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:46.069
Oh yes... Mr. Rohit Kumar.

00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:47.942
-Do you sing?
-Yes, Sir.

00:31:48.277 --> 00:31:50.378
I see. For whom have
you sung till now?

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.594
-Nothing special yet.
-Yes. Go on.

00:31:53.817 --> 00:31:55.169
I want to sing for you.

00:31:55.249 --> 00:31:56.561
-Of course.
-Thank you.

00:31:58.144 --> 00:32:00.180
-Don't forget to give my cassette.
-Oh yes. But, stop it now, will you?

00:32:02.151 --> 00:32:04.086
-Yes... what is it?
-I'm not only a singer.

00:32:04.175 --> 00:32:06.904
I've written a few songs too.

00:32:07.127 --> 00:32:08.840
-And what are you?
-A composer.

00:32:10.312 --> 00:32:12.872
In a country like ours, just
about anyone can turn a composer.

00:32:15.223 --> 00:32:20.442
Call me up on Monday. If your
voice is worth it, you're made.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.615
I'll come over on Monday
after giving you a call.

00:32:23.814 --> 00:32:25.566
-What more could you want?
Hail mother. -Mr. Gulbadan

00:32:25.652 --> 00:32:26.652
Yes, Sir.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.318
Why aren't you giving
him my cassette?

00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:31.332
-I can't give the cassette now.
-Why?

00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:33.985
It was so difficult getting an
audition for myself. -So what?

00:32:34.542 --> 00:32:36.694
How can I ask them to
audition my wife too?

00:32:36.876 --> 00:32:38.583
They'll think I'm trying to force
my family down their throats.

00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:40.873
Please cheers for amar kaushik.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.656
So, d'you feel that I'm
imposing myself upon you?

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.930
I never said that.

00:33:02.387 --> 00:33:05.963
-That's what you meant! -I'm tired
and I don't want to get into a fight.

00:33:06.161 --> 00:33:07.730
D'you mean to say that
I want to get into a fight?

00:33:07.862 --> 00:33:09.030
Sonu is sleeping.

00:33:09.598 --> 00:33:13.550
I'd only asked you to
hand over my cassette.

00:33:14.713 --> 00:33:16.495
Was it so difficult?

00:33:17.033 --> 00:33:21.033
I haven't heard what you've recorded.
I don't even know what's in it.

00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:22.555
I don't know if
it's worth a hearing.

00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:24.223
And, it was tough
getting an audition.

00:33:24.517 --> 00:33:26.771
Must I lose a chance by
trying to push your cassette?

00:33:29.785 --> 00:33:33.634
An hour ago, you loved my voice.
Now, it isn't worth auditioning!

00:33:33.776 --> 00:33:34.950
I don't mean that.

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.263
-One must practice regularly to be
able to sing properly. -Practice.

00:33:37.476 --> 00:33:40.536
Just another excuse! And I think
I understand you perfectly, Rohit.

00:33:40.958 --> 00:33:45.369
You've been pursuing your career.
And all I get are flimsy excuses.

00:33:45.449 --> 00:33:46.340
Please don't scream.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.746
Why don't you say it plainly?
That I don't have the aesthetics.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.935
That I should stop dreaming about
becoming a professional singer.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.352
That's not what's
going to be, Rohit.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:02.467
I won't give up! And you for one,
cannot break my resolve! Get that?

00:34:06.788 --> 00:34:11.074
I don't know why Rohit is doing
this. He mustn't do this to you.

00:34:11.474 --> 00:34:14.030
-It's wrong on his part. -We've
finished our homework, Mother.

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:15.257
May we go to play?

00:34:15.741 --> 00:34:17.745
-Make sure you return soon.
-All right.

00:34:22.118 --> 00:34:26.419
You have the right to a career. Why
don't you discuss it with Rohit?

00:34:31.264 --> 00:34:33.829
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you so long.

00:34:34.393 --> 00:34:36.256
-I had to discuss some things
with Farida. -What?

00:34:36.835 --> 00:34:38.876
Besides Sonu is getting on my
nerves. Who is to take care of him?

00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:41.816
I have to go to a rehearsal. Where
are my clothes? How about some food?

00:34:42.507 --> 00:34:45.939
-I'm coming over.
-And, where's the file of my songs?

00:34:46.232 --> 00:34:48.348
I've been looking for it all
day. I just can't find it.

00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:50.670
I'd brought it down with
me for my practice session.

00:34:56.722 --> 00:34:59.258
Why don't you just sit over here
for the rest of the day practicing!

00:34:59.655 --> 00:35:00.519
-I said I'm coming.
-Don't bother.

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:02.026
You can practice singing
for the rest of the day.

00:35:02.128 --> 00:35:03.331
I'll feed myself at a restaurant.

00:35:03.569 --> 00:35:06.365
-I'll look after the household too.
-Have I ever refused to do all that?

00:35:16.457 --> 00:35:20.210
-What've you done? -Sorry, Mother.
-You've got my washing all dirty.

00:35:20.403 --> 00:35:24.630
I've been at the laundry for 2 hours.
And I've asked you not to play here.

00:35:25.905 --> 00:35:28.587
How many times have
I asked you not to play?!

00:35:30.063 --> 00:35:31.896
What's up, Kiran?
Why did you beat him?

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.242
What has he done?

00:35:33.424 --> 00:35:37.137
He won't listen to me. And now,
he's got the laundry all dirty.

00:35:38.648 --> 00:35:43.180
I'm sick and tired of chorus
all day. I've gone out of my mind.

00:35:48.721 --> 00:35:49.721
Kiran...

00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:55.298
Kiran.

00:35:56.963 --> 00:36:00.277
We tread upon the same path, Kiran.
What could be better for both of us?

00:36:01.822 --> 00:36:04.576
Our destination is same.
We'll reach there together.

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:27.247
I am sorry sonu... sorry.

00:36:33.339 --> 00:36:34.342
I love you.

00:36:43.144 --> 00:36:44.144
Kiran...

00:36:45.407 --> 00:36:46.407
Kiran.

00:36:47.552 --> 00:36:48.978
Open up, quickly.

00:36:50.183 --> 00:36:52.506
Come on, hurry up.

00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:56.644
Make sure to remember
the day today.

00:36:57.405 --> 00:36:59.242
We'll celebrate
this day every year.

00:36:59.322 --> 00:37:00.934
This is the day
I've awaited forever.

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:02.800
The day on which
my career commences!

00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:06.770
Today was the day! Amar-Kaushik were
left speechless after I auditioned.

00:37:07.524 --> 00:37:10.254
I'm singing the first song
for Pawan Chopra's new film.

00:37:11.553 --> 00:37:12.553
I'm leaving, Rohit.

00:37:13.467 --> 00:37:17.296
And they said that if this song
passes the muster while recording...

00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:19.735
...I'll get to sing all the songs
for the film. I'm recording tomorrow.

00:37:20.188 --> 00:37:22.377
-Want to come along?
-I said I'm leaving.

00:37:23.779 --> 00:37:25.728
-Where are you going?
-Here are the keys to the house.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.884
These are the rationing cards...
and here are the bills for the month.

00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:30.778
I've paid all the bills.

00:37:31.229 --> 00:37:33.184
You'll find the balance of
the money in the cupboard.

00:37:34.025 --> 00:37:37.514
Here's the electricity bill. Make
sure you pay it up by the weekend.

00:37:40.296 --> 00:37:41.418
I'm leaving you.

00:37:42.358 --> 00:37:45.041
Wait a minute! What are
you saying? What's happened?

00:37:45.325 --> 00:37:47.726
-Have I done anything wrong?
-No, you haven't.

00:37:47.836 --> 00:37:49.220
-What's it then? Tell me.
-Don't touch me!

00:37:50.057 --> 00:37:52.796
-Just let me go. -But why are
you leaving? Say something!

00:37:52.947 --> 00:37:54.760
Why don't you understand!

00:37:56.846 --> 00:37:58.909
It isn't just an
isolated something.

00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:01.136
It might be my mistake too.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.705
-Something is happening to me.
-What's this with you?

00:38:06.832 --> 00:38:10.158
-I don't know! -It's nothing more
than a figment of your imagination.

00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:13.326
Please, let me go.

00:38:14.235 --> 00:38:15.855
I must make a life for myself.

00:38:16.205 --> 00:38:17.677
But this and here,
is what your life is!

00:38:17.757 --> 00:38:20.357
No! This is your life,
only yours.

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:23.307
And I want to handle myself.

00:38:24.703 --> 00:38:26.481
Else, I'll go out of my mind.

00:38:28.562 --> 00:38:30.324
So you want to walk
out of this marriage.

00:38:32.219 --> 00:38:33.599
But what of Sonu?

00:38:34.096 --> 00:38:35.543
How can you walk out on him?

00:38:35.635 --> 00:38:36.635
I love him.

00:38:40.086 --> 00:38:41.518
But, he's better off without me.

00:38:41.676 --> 00:38:45.707
Oh God! I don't believe this!
Kiran! Why are you doing this to me?!

00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:50.142
I've just got my golden chance. And
here you are... walking out on me!

00:38:51.945 --> 00:38:56.061
I need you, Kiran. If you stand by
me, I can even reach for the stars.

00:38:57.481 --> 00:38:59.899
But you had told me that we'd
reach out for the stars together.

00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:06.931
D'you feel that I'm trying to
stop you from becoming a singer?

00:39:07.477 --> 00:39:09.972
You might dream of
becoming a singer.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.715
But don't expect me to go around
singing false praises for you.

00:39:15.558 --> 00:39:17.427
Look, I am sorry.

00:39:18.267 --> 00:39:21.505
I lost my head. I agree that
both of us have made mistakes.

00:39:21.963 --> 00:39:24.611
But that doesn't mean that you must
walk out of your home. Isn't that so?

00:39:24.814 --> 00:39:27.861
We can always mend our
ways. Now, come in.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.161
Now you're being stubborn.
Just like your parents.

00:39:32.958 --> 00:39:36.018
-Don't drag my parents into this.
-Why not? You carry the same traits.

00:39:36.252 --> 00:39:37.822
Now, are you going to
stop taunting my parents?!

00:39:37.902 --> 00:39:40.266
Won't I! They haven't been able
to achieve anything in life.

00:39:40.454 --> 00:39:42.018
And they're jealous of others.

00:39:44.786 --> 00:39:47.591
And d'you think I'm jealous
of your success? -Yes!

00:39:50.072 --> 00:39:53.005
Thank you very much.
I won't ever forget that.

00:39:53.767 --> 00:39:58.825
I'd rather suffer my traits than
your taunts for the rest of my life.

00:40:20.802 --> 00:40:21.802
Rohit...

00:40:22.371 --> 00:40:23.507
Where has Kiran gone?

00:40:24.646 --> 00:40:27.315
-What I should be asking you?
-Why me?

00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:29.534
She used to spend more than half
her working hours in your company.

00:40:29.845 --> 00:40:33.583
And the two of you must've more
than discussed my weak points.

00:40:33.963 --> 00:40:36.964
Forget all that.
Kiran has left you.

00:40:37.222 --> 00:40:39.247
-We must do something about it.
-Not "we". It's I who has to do.

00:40:39.405 --> 00:40:40.999
And I'll do whatever must be done.

00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:42.219
Rohit.

00:40:42.299 --> 00:40:45.887
You must try to understand it now
or never. Kiran is very unhappy.

00:40:46.134 --> 00:40:48.506
-And the fact is that...
-Fact remains that of the past 6 years...

00:40:48.633 --> 00:40:52.079
...I've been trying heart
and soul to get a break...

00:40:52.212 --> 00:40:54.243
...so that my career can take
off; so that my life shapes up!

00:40:54.538 --> 00:40:57.921
After 6 long years, I get a break.
I'm slated to sing for Amar-Kaushik!

00:40:58.299 --> 00:41:00.183
I took a cab home as soon as
I got to know; so that I could...

00:41:00.263 --> 00:41:02.575
...share the greatest
moment of my life with her.

00:41:02.655 --> 00:41:04.707
And she tells me that she's
walking out of my life.

00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:06.767
What does it mean?!

00:41:06.858 --> 00:41:10.377
She couldn't share the
greatest moment of your life.

00:41:11.073 --> 00:41:16.269
-It's your life, after all.
-You're fantastic! Your fabulous.

00:41:17.792 --> 00:41:21.624
That your husband deserted
you because you were unhappy...

00:41:21.909 --> 00:41:24.323
...doesn't mean that every woman
is unhappy with her husband.

00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:32.508
I haven't come here to discuss my
husband. I'm concerned about Kiran.

00:41:33.203 --> 00:41:36.002
-You may keep your concern within
your confines. -I shall.

00:41:36.622 --> 00:41:39.862
Before I leave, let me tell you that
you could never understand Kiran.

00:41:40.569 --> 00:41:42.930
She is no petty woman to serve
as a part of your interior decor.

00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:47.526
She had her own dreams. And it takes
courage for a woman to walk out.

00:41:48.529 --> 00:41:49.529
Yes!

00:41:49.767 --> 00:41:53.525
And it takes more to walk out on
a helpless child. Isn't that so?

00:42:27.935 --> 00:42:31.266
Daddy... daddy... daddy... daddy.

00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:35.890
-Why are you sleeping here?
-Oh... what? -And where's Mummy?

00:42:36.626 --> 00:42:37.855
Ohh! God!

00:42:39.895 --> 00:42:42.870
-Tell me... Where's Mummy?
-What's the time now?

00:42:44.005 --> 00:42:46.472
The small hand is on 7.
And the big hand is on 3.

00:42:48.308 --> 00:42:50.785
I'm going to be late
for the recording.

00:42:50.865 --> 00:42:55.045
-Tell me, Daddy... where's Mummy?
-Wait a minute.

00:42:59.068 --> 00:43:02.891
-You mother has gone to your aunt's.
-Which aunt?

00:43:03.465 --> 00:43:07.282
-The one in Pune.
-Aunt Ratna lives there.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.079
That's where she has gone.

00:43:09.227 --> 00:43:13.427
-When is she going to come back?
-Very soon... in 3 or 4 days.

00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:15.899
Now make a move.
I've got to get ready.

00:43:18.316 --> 00:43:21.847
-Who's going to get me
ready for school? -I will, son.

00:43:23.564 --> 00:43:25.643
-And, who'll pack my school bag?
-I will.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.872
-Who'll take me to school?
-I will.

00:43:31.034 --> 00:43:35.981
-What about my breakfast?
-I... what do you eat for breakfast?

00:43:36.118 --> 00:43:39.437
An omelette of 2 eggs, toast
with butter and Bournvita.

00:43:44.161 --> 00:43:48.584
A dash of coriander... and onions.
Ever had one of my omelets?

00:43:49.308 --> 00:43:52.915
-No.
-Try it today. You'll love it.

00:43:54.961 --> 00:43:58.737
-You're cutting them in such
large chunks! -That's just fine.

00:44:00.445 --> 00:44:02.293
Isn't this fun! Yes, it's fun.

00:44:03.115 --> 00:44:04.034
Now, take a look at this...

00:44:04.114 --> 00:44:07.419
a circus with one hand...
two eggs in one hand!

00:44:07.932 --> 00:44:10.070
Now take a look at how
I break both eggs using one hand.

00:44:13.979 --> 00:44:17.219
The eggs had soft-shells.
But never mind.

00:44:19.994 --> 00:44:22.070
This place is perfectly clean.

00:44:23.944 --> 00:44:26.778
What are you doing?
I'm not going to eat that!

00:44:27.108 --> 00:44:30.891
-It has shells in it. -A few
shells will make the omelette crisp.

00:44:31.608 --> 00:44:33.360
-Here go the onions...
and the chilies. -Not that way!

00:44:33.466 --> 00:44:34.188
How else?

00:44:34.268 --> 00:44:38.203
Mummy used to flip
the ingredients first.

00:44:38.339 --> 00:44:39.425
What Mummy doesn't know...

00:44:39.545 --> 00:44:42.116
...is that an omelette is an
omelette, flip or flap!

00:44:42.605 --> 00:44:45.638
Eat it and you'll know. Later
on, I'll drop you at the school.

00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:48.739
And afterwards, I'm off to
record my first song ever!

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.064
Your Daddy is going to
become a famous singer.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.766
Daddy! Daddy!

00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:56.897
-What's up? -The toast is burning!
-Oh no!

00:44:57.651 --> 00:44:58.428
Oh no!

00:44:58.508 --> 00:44:59.755
Well, never mind that.

00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:04.700
Oh no!

00:45:11.673 --> 00:45:13.323
You don't know a thing!

00:45:14.457 --> 00:45:15.645
C'mon! Come on fast.

00:45:16.521 --> 00:45:19.481
Go on in... hurry. Go inside.

00:45:19.715 --> 00:45:21.721
-Who'll come to pick me up?
-I'll come.

00:45:22.191 --> 00:45:24.019
Where are you going to wait for me?

00:45:25.142 --> 00:45:27.148
I'll wait for you under this
tree, okay? Now go on inside.

00:45:28.265 --> 00:45:30.830
-What if you don't turn up?
-I said I'll come. And, I will.

00:45:31.445 --> 00:45:32.746
What if you're late?

00:45:33.438 --> 00:45:35.171
I won't be late.
I'll be here on time.

00:45:35.602 --> 00:45:37.271
What if you're still late?

00:45:40.132 --> 00:45:41.914
If I am, you can
wait under the tree.

00:45:42.234 --> 00:45:43.412
Okay? And wait for me.

00:45:43.655 --> 00:45:45.015
Go on, now. Hurry.

00:45:47.226 --> 00:45:48.197
Sunil!

00:45:48.277 --> 00:45:50.421
-When does the school get over?
-No idea.

00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:54.489
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

00:45:54.615 --> 00:45:56.450
When does the junior
school get over?

00:45:56.932 --> 00:45:59.585
-I'm that child's father.
-At 2 o'clock.

00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:01.186
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:46:12.023 --> 00:46:15.520
-I'm sorry to be late.
-Is this your idea of time?

00:46:16.302 --> 00:46:18.608
You've turned a star even before
you've recorded a single song.

00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:20.768
I got stuck in the traffic.

00:46:20.848 --> 00:46:23.030
Never mind.
Sit inside and get the lines.

00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:24.517
We'll record the
orchestra in the meantime

00:46:24.597 --> 00:46:26.653
-Give him his lines, will you?
-Let's have another take.

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.407
Come on for the break in your life.

00:46:34.009 --> 00:46:36.728
-We can fit the 16 tracks on to 12.
-Very well. Let's try.

00:46:37.389 --> 00:46:38.741
We're ready, Mr. Pradeep.

00:46:40.744 --> 00:46:42.203
Let's have the rhythm.

00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:43.908
Silence! Silence!

00:46:45.818 --> 00:46:49.812
Still waiting here? I'm afraid
we won't be recording you today.

00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:53.255
-Sir?
-Increase the bass slightly.

00:46:53.854 --> 00:46:58.401
-When will I record?
-After a couple of days perhaps.

00:46:58.738 --> 00:47:00.296
Do keep calling to find out.

00:47:01.057 --> 00:47:02.057
Okay.

00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:31.268
I'm late by only half-an-hour.
Must you be so upset?

00:47:31.439 --> 00:47:34.878
-You said you'd be here on time.
-I did. But I was so busy.

00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:39.994
-What if someone kidnapped me?
-But no one did?

00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:41.975
What if someone did?

00:47:43.096 --> 00:47:45.808
I've told ten times that I'm sorry.

00:47:46.225 --> 00:47:48.319
You must forgive
someone who apologizes.

00:47:48.838 --> 00:47:50.074
Do you know the meaning
of the word "sorry"?

00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:52.069
Sunil! Sunil!

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.923
What are you doing?

00:47:57.878 --> 00:47:58.878
What's up?

00:48:00.848 --> 00:48:05.864
This car run on batteries. It has a
horn. And, the headlights work too.

00:48:07.345 --> 00:48:11.389
-So what?
-I'll forgive you if you buy me one.

00:48:13.441 --> 00:48:15.563
What if I don't?
Won't you forgive me ever?

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.951
Had it been Mummy, she
would've got the car for me.

00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:24.033
Ask your mother for one when she
comes back. Now, let's go. Come on.

00:48:28.564 --> 00:48:31.657
-250 grams of lentil... anything else?
-A packet of tea.

00:48:32.257 --> 00:48:35.140
-The Red Label, or the Yellow?
-Yellow. -Not Yellow. The Red one.

00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:37.960
-Why? -Because Mummy used
to buy the Red Label.

00:48:38.931 --> 00:48:40.031
Give me red.

00:48:42.955 --> 00:48:44.884
A pack of soap and coconut oil.

00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:50.151
-Can I have a chocolate?
-Take these upstairs.

00:48:55.467 --> 00:48:59.430
Forgive me for asking this...
but I heard something. Is it true?

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:03.633
I heard that your wife left your...

00:49:04.129 --> 00:49:06.158
...no, I mean to say that
she didn't care for you.

00:49:06.353 --> 00:49:08.568
She didn't care for the child.
Nor her status!

00:49:08.791 --> 00:49:09.934
-Let me have this package.
-Here.

00:49:10.138 --> 00:49:14.400
And I didn't like her either.
She used to have this temper.

00:49:14.562 --> 00:49:16.865
Have I asked you what you
liked or disliked about my wife?

00:49:16.952 --> 00:49:18.967
-No, I mean...
-Have I asked for your opinion?

00:49:20.314 --> 00:49:22.924
I come here to buy groceries. Not
to listen to your useless banter.

00:49:23.178 --> 00:49:26.543
-Do you understand?
-Understood. Here's your stuff.

00:49:26.979 --> 00:49:30.954
That's worth 300. The balance last
month was 350, totaling 650 bucks.

00:49:31.432 --> 00:49:34.434
-And I've stopped giving credit.
-I'm not asking for it.

00:49:36.247 --> 00:49:40.128
Here's your money. 550... and I'm
sending 100 bucks for you right away.

00:49:40.587 --> 00:49:41.987
That's the credit.

00:49:47.243 --> 00:49:49.482
When cameras flash
keep waiting you.

00:49:49.581 --> 00:49:51.199
Walkman sound cracking

00:49:51.325 --> 00:49:53.090
Toy moves to stop.

00:49:53.268 --> 00:49:54.268
That time.

00:49:54.905 --> 00:49:59.140
Nippo power will work.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.472
Nippo...

00:50:01.629 --> 00:50:03.281
-Is that all right, Mr. Manohar?
-Yes. Let's record it.

00:50:04.495 --> 00:50:07.665
Thank you, Mr. Sharma for letting
my friend sing in the chorus.

00:50:07.926 --> 00:50:08.967
No problem.

00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:13.507
-She'll even sing a lead part
if you let her do it. -Of course.

00:50:13.938 --> 00:50:15.304
Shall we proceed, Mr. Manohar?

00:50:17.098 --> 00:50:18.888
Daddy! Daddy!

00:50:19.313 --> 00:50:22.468
Take a look at this!
A letter from Mummy.

00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:25.012
A letter from Mummy! Here!

00:50:26.405 --> 00:50:29.126
-I see... it's addressed to you.
-Oh yes! It is.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.637
Read it, quickly. And tell
me when Mummy is coming home.

00:50:37.988 --> 00:50:39.744
-Read it aloud.
-Oh, yes.

00:50:41.575 --> 00:50:42.975
"My dear Sunil..."

00:50:46.264 --> 00:50:48.967
"You must be wondering where your
Mummy has gone all of a sudden."

00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:51.900
"Let me explain this... sometimes
your Daddy had to leave home."

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:54.081
"And then, it was Mummy
who looked after you."

00:50:54.654 --> 00:50:58.597
"Sometimes, when mothers leave,
fathers have to look after children."

00:51:01.633 --> 00:51:03.757
"Your Mummy wants to make a
career for herself, Sunil."

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.412
"That's why I had
to leave your home."

00:51:08.229 --> 00:51:12.730
"I may not live with you anymore.
But, you'll remain in my heart."

00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:17.096
"Don't ever think that
Mummy will forget you."

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.293
"I remain your Mummy always.
And I'll love you always."

00:51:22.828 --> 00:51:24.022
"Take care of yourself.

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.821
And, on your
way back from school everyday..."

00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:28.209
Sunil!

00:51:29.667 --> 00:51:30.667
Sunil!

00:51:38.307 --> 00:51:46.024
"Blushing face, intoxication eyes
this ambience is enchanting."

00:51:46.493 --> 00:51:50.296
"Tell me,
How do I live now?"

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:54.491
What do my heart do now?

00:51:56.207 --> 00:51:57.430
That was marvelous. Ms. Vandana.

00:51:57.653 --> 00:51:59.452
And you must concentrate, Rohit.

00:51:59.532 --> 00:52:00.143
Yes, sir.

00:52:00.223 --> 00:52:02.143
I want the right perspective
in your voice. -Yes, sir.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.038
Don't sing in a stifled voice.
Open your voice up.

00:52:04.159 --> 00:52:05.796
-"Blushing face"
-Excuse me, sir.

00:52:06.266 --> 00:52:07.266
Sir..

00:52:07.841 --> 00:52:10.557
That's my file, Sir. It contains
the songs I have written.

00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:13.800
Don't be afraid.
We won't steal your tunes.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.861
No! I didn't mean that.

00:52:15.961 --> 00:52:18.068
Let's proceed with another take.

00:52:20.568 --> 00:52:22.764
Let's have a rehearsal without
the music accompaniment.

00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:28.492
"Blushing face, intoxication eyes
this ambience.."

00:52:28.614 --> 00:52:31.880
That's a lot of crap! Let's have
some real voice. Haven't you eaten?

00:52:33.135 --> 00:52:37.389
-Blushing face, intoxication eyes..
-"Blushing face.."

00:52:37.548 --> 00:52:38.722
Face..

00:52:38.868 --> 00:52:40.563
Blushing face..

00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:43.407
-Go on... sing it.
-Yes, Sir.

00:52:44.467 --> 00:52:47.875
-Face Blushing.
-"Blushing face.."

00:52:48.747 --> 00:52:50.582
-Blushing face..
-Cut, cut cut.

00:52:51.348 --> 00:52:56.303
Forget about turning a music
director and concentrate on singing.

00:52:56.595 --> 00:52:59.264
-I'll ruin his happiness.
-Why! We have a composer!

00:53:00.773 --> 00:53:02.276
Blushing face..

00:53:02.378 --> 00:53:05.196
Pink, pink
Blushing face..

00:53:05.558 --> 00:53:06.900
Blushing face..

00:53:07.103 --> 00:53:09.069
-Go on.
-Yes, Sir.

00:53:10.949 --> 00:53:11.949
Face..

00:53:12.038 --> 00:53:13.156
Nonsense! Forget it.

00:53:13.572 --> 00:53:16.413
Please sing his lines
for him, Ms. Vandana.

00:53:18.224 --> 00:53:26.577
Blushing face, intoxication eyes
this ambience is enchanting.

00:53:26.898 --> 00:53:31.279
-Well done, Ms. Vandana. Excellent.
-Did you get an idea of the tune?

00:53:31.477 --> 00:53:36.693
-That's what I've been singing.
-Sing it properly! -Yes, Sir.

00:53:38.599 --> 00:53:42.475
-Blushing face, intoxication eyes
-What nonsense.

00:53:42.714 --> 00:53:46.932
What are you doing! You're out
of tune! What are you up to?!

00:53:47.098 --> 00:53:48.496
-Please let me finish my lines.
-Shut up!

00:53:48.727 --> 00:53:51.422
If you interrupt, you
can't appreciate the singing.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.256
-Shut up!
-Please listen to me.

00:53:53.745 --> 00:53:56.372
Bloody fool! Who
d'you think you are?

00:53:56.651 --> 00:53:58.895
Stay within your limits!
Else I'll throw you out of here.

00:53:58.975 --> 00:54:00.890
And, I'll banish you
forever from filmdom.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:06.008
Will a singer in a night club to
teach me how to compose music?!

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.630
-Yes. I can.
-What! What was it you said?!

00:54:10.346 --> 00:54:11.884
Oh yes! I'll teach you how
to score music right away.

00:54:12.026 --> 00:54:13.834
That is, if you may
dare to listen to me.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.219
Isn't this how you've composed it?

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.181
Blushing face, intoxication eyes
this ambience is..

00:54:20.283 --> 00:54:21.765
Isn't that your song?
Now listen to this.

00:54:22.557 --> 00:54:23.984
Please play along with me.

00:54:27.846 --> 00:54:36.837
"Blushing face, intoxication eyes
this ambience is enchanting."

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:42.236
Tell me,
How do I live now?

00:54:42.458 --> 00:54:47.455
What do my heart do now?

00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:48.950
"Blushing face"

00:54:55.668 --> 00:54:56.668
Get out!

00:54:56.931 --> 00:54:57.931
Get out!

00:55:05.045 --> 00:55:07.218
What are you up to, Sunil?
Be quiet and eat your food.

00:55:08.403 --> 00:55:09.403
Pick up your spoon.

00:55:10.859 --> 00:55:11.859
Go on. Eat.

00:55:14.342 --> 00:55:15.867
It's yucky.

00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:18.067
It's bell plant and it's very
good for you. Go on, eat it.

00:55:18.718 --> 00:55:23.414
-I don't like bell plants. -You do.
Aunt Farida has cooked it for you.

00:55:23.531 --> 00:55:24.907
And you've eaten it earlier.

00:55:25.303 --> 00:55:28.011
-What's all this black stuff in this?
-Onions. Now eat it.

00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:31.341
-Onions give me stomachaches.
-Not at all.

00:55:32.601 --> 00:55:34.559
And now start with the bread.

00:55:41.292 --> 00:55:43.316
-It's Yucky.
-You mustn't call food "yucky".

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.917
Don't spit on your plate.
Where are your manners?

00:55:48.821 --> 00:55:50.954
Go on. Eat it now. There...
I've removed the onions.

00:55:59.243 --> 00:56:00.243
Daddy!

00:56:00.522 --> 00:56:04.023
There's this chocolate ice-cream
you've brought. It's in the fridge.

00:56:04.104 --> 00:56:07.938
Yes I know about the ice cream.
But, you won't get any of it.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.484
You must finish your food first.
Only afterwards you may eat it.

00:56:10.825 --> 00:56:12.384
Sunil! Where are you going?

00:56:12.962 --> 00:56:14.234
Don't you open the fridge!

00:56:15.733 --> 00:56:17.798
Now don't take the
ice-cream out of the fridge.

00:56:19.536 --> 00:56:22.781
Can't you hear me? I'm getting
very angry with this now.

00:56:26.146 --> 00:56:29.934
Don't take the ice cream.
I'm warning you, Sunil.

00:56:30.622 --> 00:56:33.914
I'm warning you. Don't you
dare eat that ice cream.

00:56:34.409 --> 00:56:35.409
Sunil.

00:56:36.421 --> 00:56:41.710
Eat the ice-cream and you'll face
dire consequences. D'you understand?

00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:44.631
Sunil!

00:56:44.749 --> 00:56:48.157
Now! And let go of the chair.

00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:50.510
You unmannered boy!
And stop screaming.

00:56:50.939 --> 00:56:52.731
Mummy!

00:56:52.904 --> 00:56:55.005
-I want to go to Mummy!
-Enough of it.

00:56:55.213 --> 00:56:57.194
No food for you. Nor any ice
cream. You can go to sleep hungry.

00:56:57.315 --> 00:56:58.960
I hate you. I won't
talk to you ever again.

00:56:59.763 --> 00:57:02.120
I don't care.
I won't speak with you. Nonsense.

00:58:02.921 --> 00:58:03.921
Sonu!

00:58:04.178 --> 00:58:05.229
I'm sorry.

00:58:06.513 --> 00:58:07.600
I'm also sorry.

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:09.850
Will you leave me and go away too?

00:58:10.708 --> 00:58:12.041
Never.

00:58:12.723 --> 00:58:14.763
But Mummy left me and went away.

00:58:15.134 --> 00:58:16.851
That's because I'm a bad boy.

00:58:17.618 --> 00:58:18.953
Is that what you think?

00:58:21.775 --> 00:58:23.075
That isn't true.

00:58:24.808 --> 00:58:25.940
Mummy loves you.

00:58:27.011 --> 00:58:28.667
She didn't leave because of you.

00:58:29.185 --> 00:58:32.736
She left because
I couldn't understand her.

00:58:34.982 --> 00:58:38.023
I wanted her to do what all other
mothers do all their lives...

00:58:40.042 --> 00:58:42.281
...tending the family
and doing household chores.

00:58:45.511 --> 00:58:47.263
But she wanted to
do something else.

00:58:49.371 --> 00:58:51.135
And she tried to reason with me.

00:58:53.687 --> 00:59:00.735
But I was too involved
with my life and myself.

00:59:01.542 --> 00:59:03.827
And do you know why she
stayed back so long with us?

00:59:06.088 --> 00:59:07.979
That's because she loved you, son.

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.824
She didn't leave us because of you.

00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:15.200
She left because of me.

00:59:18.535 --> 00:59:21.562
Now, go to sleep.

00:59:25.719 --> 00:59:27.983
Let's start a new
life from tomorrow...

00:59:29.871 --> 00:59:31.261
you and me.

00:59:32.371 --> 00:59:33.904
-Okay?
-Daddy.

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:35.900
Yes.

00:59:35.986 --> 00:59:36.989
I love you.

00:59:40.521 --> 00:59:41.521
I love you, Sonu.

00:59:42.643 --> 00:59:43.653
I love you.

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:13.696
"I am alone, you are alone"

01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:18.733
"If you and I are together
then what's the pain?"

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:23.740
"You are my heart, you are my life"

01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:27.425
"Oh I love you Daddy"

01:00:28.933 --> 01:00:33.426
"You are innocent,
you are mischievous"

01:00:33.711 --> 01:00:36.952
"But you love me Daddy"

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:42.554
"You are my heart, you are my life"

01:00:43.322 --> 01:00:46.620
"Oh I love you Daddy"

01:00:48.174 --> 01:00:52.571
"You are innocent,
you are mischievous"

01:00:52.969 --> 01:00:56.590
"But you love me Daddy"

01:01:26.631 --> 01:01:31.160
"Granted, you are little"

01:01:31.542 --> 01:01:34.896
"But you are the
teacher of everyone"

01:01:36.369 --> 01:01:40.864
"And with this mischief"

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:44.513
"You are the heart
and soul of everyone"

01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:50.991
"To speak like this,
there are a thousand"

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:56.111
"But where is there
someone like you?"

01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:00.797
"I am alone, you are alone"

01:02:01.414 --> 01:02:05.659
"If you and I are together
then what's the pain?"

01:02:06.467 --> 01:02:10.407
"You are my heart, you are my life"

01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:14.560
"Oh I love you Daddy"

01:02:16.045 --> 01:02:20.455
"You are innocent,
you are mischievous"

01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:25.454
"But you love me Daddy"

01:02:49.736 --> 01:02:54.214
"Believe this,
if tomorrow the whole world"

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:57.925
"Does not stand by me"

01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:05.906
"Who then is the
companion of my journey?"

01:03:05.986 --> 01:03:07.615
"I am, Daddy"

01:03:09.477 --> 01:03:13.843
"Today how beautiful it seems"

01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:18.451
"Our world, our moments"

01:03:19.626 --> 01:03:24.073
"I am alone, you are alone"

01:03:24.503 --> 01:03:28.832
"If you and I are together
then what's the pain?"

01:03:29.526 --> 01:03:33.082
"You are my heart, you are my life"

01:03:34.317 --> 01:03:37.533
"Oh I love you Daddy"

01:03:39.164 --> 01:03:43.536
"You are innocent,
you are mischievous"

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:48.266
"But you love me Daddy"

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:53.356
"You are my heart, you are my life"

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:57.534
"Oh I love you Daddy"

01:03:58.423 --> 01:04:03.048
"You are innocent,
you are mischievous"

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:07.355
"But you love me Daddy"

01:04:08.019 --> 01:04:12.147
"But you love me Daddy"

01:04:22.664 --> 01:04:25.323
-Let's have another ride. -No.
I'm tired. Go on. Play by yourself.

01:04:31.143 --> 01:04:32.781
You've changed so
completely, Rohit.

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:36.757
I only wish Kiran should've
seen you in these spirits.

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.585
-Don't talk about Kiran.
-Very well.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:44.940
-Tell me the truth... don't you
ever think about her? -Not at all.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.966
Look at me, Daddy!

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.234
-Don't do that, Sunil.
-No! It's my turn now!

01:04:56.942 --> 01:05:00.815
Don't you think about your husband?

01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:03.731
His case was quite different.

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.345
He had started having an affair.

01:05:07.386 --> 01:05:10.201
Really? I had no idea. Who was it?

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.380
He had this girl in his office.

01:05:13.832 --> 01:05:15.639
And my Romeo wanted
to bring her home.

01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:17.083
What nonsense!

01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:20.746
Look at me now, Daddy! I'm
coming down standing up!

01:05:20.826 --> 01:05:23.650
-No, Sonu. What are you up to?
Get down. -I'll get him down.

01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:26.266
What happened afterwards?

01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:29.381
I told him he was
free to do what he liked.

01:05:29.736 --> 01:05:32.036
But I wouldn't let go of the house.
It's for my children and me.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:33.004
Daddy!

01:05:33.084 --> 01:05:34.651
-No! Sonu!
-Watch your step, Sonu!

01:05:35.562 --> 01:05:36.562
Daddy!

01:05:36.679 --> 01:05:39.359
What's happened, Sonu?!

01:05:39.933 --> 01:05:41.487
Take him to a hospital. Hurry!

01:05:53.272 --> 01:05:54.642
Auto Rickshaw please.

01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:58.591
Nothing's going to
happen to you, Sonu.

01:06:04.353 --> 01:06:05.825
Daddy!

01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:07.328
It's okay.

01:06:07.725 --> 01:06:09.848
It's okay, Sonu.
I love you.

01:06:10.472 --> 01:06:11.472
It's ok.

01:06:12.863 --> 01:06:14.660
Good.

01:06:15.935 --> 01:06:16.935
It's okay, Sonu.

01:06:17.053 --> 01:06:19.632
I'll treat you to
ice creams afterwards.

01:06:32.391 --> 01:06:36.513
"Let bygones be bygones"

01:06:36.671 --> 01:06:40.477
"This is a new day with new hope."

01:06:40.714 --> 01:06:42.812
She is good.
She is really good.

01:06:43.056 --> 01:06:44.056
Thank you.

01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:47.265
Excuse me, madam.
Hello.

01:06:47.448 --> 01:06:51.183
I'm Ravinder Kapoor. I'm the chief
assistant director in RP Films.

01:06:51.455 --> 01:06:54.335
-I see. -I have come here
for a sound transfer.

01:06:54.786 --> 01:06:57.236
I saw your friend all of
a sudden. She's very good.

01:06:57.868 --> 01:07:02.262
My director wants a smart girl as he
is about to shoot an important scene.

01:07:02.865 --> 01:07:04.464
The role is that of a
friend to the leading lady.

01:07:04.704 --> 01:07:05.525
You mean extras.

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:06.833
No. Not stand-by.

01:07:07.766 --> 01:07:09.175
It's small character.

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:10.628
You don't know Mr. Kapoor.

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:12.418
Mr. Kapoor is very particular
abut the characters.

01:07:12.955 --> 01:07:14.295
You mean Mr. Paresh Kapoor.

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:15.477
That's right. Mr. Paresh Kapoor.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:19.421
-You must've seen his film last
year. -Yes. -It was a super hit.

01:07:19.551 --> 01:07:20.951
It's still raking in royalties.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:25.257
-How many days is she to work at it?
-It's only a day's shoot.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.646
-But...
-How much money will she make?

01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:30.657
2000. And I'll make sure she
gets 100 bucks as conveyance.

01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:32.069
Please.

01:07:33.127 --> 01:07:35.968
-I'll speak to her about it.
-Please do try. I'll wait for you.

01:07:38.274 --> 01:07:40.388
Silence please.
Silence.

01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:42.079
Full lights.

01:07:43.319 --> 01:07:44.474
Start sound.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:47.450
-Camera!
-9/3 take one.

01:07:48.217 --> 01:07:49.217
Action.

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:53.675
I've dumped Sunju.
He says that I'm selfish.

01:07:54.259 --> 01:07:57.376
He asked me why I went to
see a film when he was sick.

01:07:57.883 --> 01:08:01.720
I couldn't bore myself sitting
by him all evening; now could I?

01:08:02.006 --> 01:08:03.358
Have I done anything wrong?

01:08:05.465 --> 01:08:07.534
Tell me, Anjali... have
I done anything wrong?

01:08:09.981 --> 01:08:10.942
Cut it.

01:08:11.022 --> 01:08:12.718
You were supposed to
deliver your lines.

01:08:13.124 --> 01:08:14.836
Don't you remember your lines?

01:08:18.106 --> 01:08:19.964
Will she be able to
deliver the lines?

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:21.874
Sir, sure she'll do it.

01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:25.678
You wanted someone simple and
innocent. She'll deliver all right.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:28.494
Didn't I tell you that I don't
know anything about acting?

01:08:28.682 --> 01:08:30.658
Don't worry. You doing just fine.

01:08:32.187 --> 01:08:33.609
Just keep remember your line.

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:37.082
9/3 take 4.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.002
Action!

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:40.362
Tell me, Anjali...
What have I done wrong?

01:08:42.212 --> 01:08:45.480
You haven't done the
right thing, Deepa.

01:08:48.296 --> 01:08:50.879
D'you remember how anxious he
was when you had fallen sick?

01:08:51.837 --> 01:08:56.128
He kept by you and cared
for you like a man possessed.

01:08:56.823 --> 01:09:00.637
And you can't even
spare an evening for him!

01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:03.455
You call that boredom.

01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:09.282
The truth is that you've
never even understood Sunju.

01:09:10.183 --> 01:09:13.411
He loves you very much.

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:16.883
Oh my God. This is too much.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:18.216
She's going on saying
whatever she wants to.

01:09:18.313 --> 01:09:19.317
Have you gone mad?

01:09:19.977 --> 01:09:20.977
Cut it.

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:22.170
I'm sorry, Sir.

01:09:22.372 --> 01:09:24.547
I'd told you earlier that
I know nothing about acting.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:28.024
I tried it at my friend's instance.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.950
I really want to become a singer.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:35.252
Very well... you may sing some.

01:09:36.613 --> 01:09:37.096
Sir?!

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:38.436
Yes, say something.

01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:57.259
"There is no regret
in life without you."

01:09:57.672 --> 01:10:04.138
"There is no regret."

01:10:30.407 --> 01:10:31.561
Please listen to
the songs I've scored.

01:10:31.712 --> 01:10:33.200
I've helped you already.

01:10:33.378 --> 01:10:36.645
I introduced you to Amar
Kaushik. And you've disgraced me.

01:10:37.146 --> 01:10:40.948
-They started misbehaving with me.
-Will they really misbehave?

01:10:42.001 --> 01:10:43.870
-You see, Mr. Gulbadan.
-You see, Mr. Rohit...

01:10:44.225 --> 01:10:46.213
I merely run a
small-time music company.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.291
We only publish
records and cassettes.

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:51.838
I'm not a film producer.
Now, please excuse me.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.086
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Please take your time.

01:11:01.107 --> 01:11:03.319
One minute, Mr. Rohit.

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:05.733
I can help you sell your songs.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:11.196
Amar Kaushik needs new tunes.
I'll get you 2000 for each tune.

01:11:11.317 --> 01:11:13.916
-Here's my card. -So they get
the credit for my compositions.

01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:15.612
Why bother about the credit?

01:11:15.822 --> 01:11:16.822
No thank you.

01:11:27.197 --> 01:11:31.170
You want me to give you a job
so you can walk out on me again.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.330
That won't happen ever again.
I beg your pardon.

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:36.520
Please give me a chance.

01:11:36.977 --> 01:11:40.727
"Never say goodbye"

01:11:41.269 --> 01:11:45.164
"Never say goodbye"

01:11:46.023 --> 01:11:57.271
"Keep singing always."

01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:06.307
Dream of love
Beginning shot.

01:12:13.232 --> 01:12:16.055
-Isn't that, Mrs. Kiran?
-Yes. She's Rohit Kumar's wife.

01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:19.180
-She's made a heroine in films.
-She used to sing.

01:12:19.354 --> 01:12:20.908
And now, she's up
to dancing in public.

01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:23.124
Come quickly, Dad.
Take a look... over there.

01:12:24.738 --> 01:12:26.058
It's Mummy's picture.

01:12:28.054 --> 01:12:30.039
They put up the posters today.

01:12:31.458 --> 01:12:35.796
I want to see Mummy's film. You'll
take me to see it, won't you?

01:12:36.443 --> 01:12:40.666
You'll take me, won't you, Daddy?
Won't you, Daddy? Please tell me.

01:13:06.464 --> 01:13:07.526
Amar Joshi.

01:13:43.456 --> 01:13:45.502
How are we to see Mummy's film now?

01:13:47.452 --> 01:13:49.528
It's a "house-full" show.
Let's go home.

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:56.000
I want to see Mummy's film! You'd
promised to show me Mummy's film.

01:13:56.742 --> 01:13:58.636
I want to see Mummy's film at once!

01:14:06.574 --> 01:14:07.975
Hurry up, Daddy.

01:14:28.682 --> 01:14:31.437
How come you're here?
No one is allowed up here.

01:14:31.526 --> 01:14:33.766
He wants to see how his
Mummy's film is projected.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.451
I spoke to the manager.

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:37.593
-Is he Ms. Kiran's son?
-Yes.

01:14:37.745 --> 01:14:39.167
Very well.
You can sit here and see it.

01:14:39.679 --> 01:14:41.951
"Tell me... what
can you do for my sake"

01:14:42.398 --> 01:14:44.315
"I'd get the sun, the
moon and the stars for you."

01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:49.984
"I'd get the sun, the
moon and the stars for you."

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.635
"I'd bring the heavens and earth
together for your sake."

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:55.460
What's the matter, honey?

01:14:55.577 --> 01:14:58.056
I'd rather love a
straightforward fellow.

01:14:58.307 --> 01:15:00.787
"You needn't bring the sun,
moon, nor the stars into this."

01:15:07.032 --> 01:15:11.343
"I see love in your eyes."

01:15:11.755 --> 01:15:16.081
"I see consent in your words."

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:18.191
"You can take your rotten son
back to America with you."

01:15:18.271 --> 01:15:20.676
"Before you leave, try
some delicious Indian cakes."

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.492
Can you tell us how you are
feeling right now, Mrs. Kiran?

01:16:12.594 --> 01:16:14.348
I'm happy to see that the audiences
have liked my performance.

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:16.426
Would you like to work
again with Paresh Kapoor?

01:16:16.506 --> 01:16:17.264
Yes, of course.

01:16:17.344 --> 01:16:20.038
Any plans for the future? What
kind of films would you like?

01:16:20.652 --> 01:16:22.165
I haven't thought about it.

01:16:22.347 --> 01:16:24.886
We hear that you are Mrs.
Kiran Kumar.

01:16:25.099 --> 01:16:28.176
-It's said that you're married,
and that you have a son. Who said that?

01:16:28.526 --> 01:16:30.259
Don't ask vulgar questions...
Please step aside.

01:16:30.339 --> 01:16:32.182
Come along, Kiran. Let's go.

01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:35.622
Mom!

01:16:37.828 --> 01:16:39.362
Mom!

01:16:58.314 --> 01:16:59.716
Mom!

01:16:59.972 --> 01:17:00.972
Please stop him.

01:17:01.357 --> 01:17:02.576
Driver stop the car.

01:17:02.921 --> 01:17:04.099
Driver don't stop.

01:17:16.519 --> 01:17:21.731
-Has Mummy forgotten me, Daddy?
-No. -Then why didn't she stop?

01:17:21.811 --> 01:17:23.557
Why didn't she talk to me?

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:30.002
-Can I go to see her sometime?
-No. -Why not?

01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:40.349
Did you see those stars?

01:17:41.716 --> 01:17:43.973
They shine, merrily, but
they are far away from us.

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:46.888
Your Mummy is now like a star.

01:17:48.336 --> 01:17:50.727
You can see her and long for her.

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.064
But you can't go anywhere near her.

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:04.840
Come on... Let's go home.

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:07.251
Then, my Mummy goes to a forest.

01:18:07.545 --> 01:18:09.779
She comes across a huge
fellow in the forest.

01:18:10.371 --> 01:18:13.875
My Mummy bashes him up.

01:18:14.911 --> 01:18:17.201
-Go upstairs, Sunil.
-After a minute, please, Daddy.

01:18:17.414 --> 01:18:22.121
Then the hero comes, and
sings a song with my Mummy.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:26.746
-My mummy's very beautiful. -Really?
-She's more beautiful than yours.

01:18:28.865 --> 01:18:32.962
Beautiful she is. But, she's
more stubborn than she's beautiful.

01:18:33.712 --> 01:18:37.495
Why don't you go over to her,
patch up and bring her back?

01:18:38.843 --> 01:18:46.058
If I go to her now, she'll think
that I've come because she's a star.

01:18:47.543 --> 01:18:48.593
Forget her.

01:18:50.264 --> 01:18:54.018
In any case, it was she who
left me. I didn't desert her.

01:18:55.368 --> 01:19:00.691
-She can return if she wants to.
-And you're very stubborn too.

01:19:01.463 --> 01:19:03.590
We've finished the cola.

01:19:05.215 --> 01:19:06.286
Hey Moolchand!

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:07.967
Hey Moolchand!

01:19:08.205 --> 01:19:11.249
-What's up? -2 Colas please.
-I've closed for the day.

01:19:11.422 --> 01:19:12.772
Down the shutter.

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:17.536
-Open up if you've closed down.
-Am I to stay open all night for you?

01:19:17.724 --> 01:19:20.646
If you're so interested, you
could walk a block to fetch it.

01:19:21.058 --> 01:19:24.273
-Why don't you fetch some for us?
-Am I your servant?

01:19:24.648 --> 01:19:29.955
-Forget him. He's an illiterate.
-What?! An illiterate, am I?!

01:19:30.035 --> 01:19:31.309
Did you call me an illiterate?

01:19:31.407 --> 01:19:35.519
Oh yes. I am an illiterate. And
I know exactly what I am. Unlike you.

01:19:35.798 --> 01:19:38.793
You sing in a rotten nightclubs and
think you're no less than Elvis.

01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:42.854
He calls me an illiterate! And he
sits drinking in front of his son.

01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:47.068
You couldn't even take care of
your wife. And he is lording it over me!

01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:49.616
You bloody! What did
you say about my wife?!

01:19:49.696 --> 01:19:51.248
-No! Don't!
-What did you say about my wife?!

01:19:51.407 --> 01:19:53.396
I'll break your face! I will!

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:57.652
-Let go! And you! Get lost!
-Don't you dare touch me!

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.922
Get lost?

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:00.667
-I will fix you.
-Go!

01:20:01.104 --> 01:20:05.480
-Let's go! Just come back here...
and I'll show you! -Don't fight!

01:20:06.819 --> 01:20:08.286
Go home, Moolchand!

01:20:09.174 --> 01:20:12.300
And you're a strange fellow. Must you
pick up a fight with such a scum?

01:20:13.027 --> 01:20:17.289
-Bad fellow! Come on, let's have
a drink. -No, he spoilt my mood.

01:20:17.674 --> 01:20:18.674
Come home, Sunil.

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:20.848
Good night.

01:20:21.755 --> 01:20:23.953
C'mon!

01:20:24.033 --> 01:20:25.392
What's it with you, now?

01:20:25.557 --> 01:20:26.557
C'mon!

01:20:27.795 --> 01:20:30.048
Hey! I just fell down.

01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:32.318
Let's squat here for sometime.

01:20:34.662 --> 01:20:37.106
Why do you drink rum, Daddy?

01:20:39.774 --> 01:20:41.314
What did you know about rum?

01:20:41.424 --> 01:20:43.436
I know everything. Rum
is an alcoholic drink.

01:20:46.148 --> 01:20:49.653
One day, a drunk came to
the gates of our school.

01:20:49.983 --> 01:20:52.622
The kids at school were teasing
him and poking fun at him.

01:20:52.702 --> 01:20:54.738
And everyone threw stones at him.

01:20:55.008 --> 01:20:57.759
I don't want anyone to
make fun of you.

01:21:02.915 --> 01:21:04.466
Do you love me so much?

01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:09.885
I love you very much too.

01:21:11.768 --> 01:21:13.297
I love you more than
anyone else on earth.

01:21:13.394 --> 01:21:16.528
If you love me so much, you
must stop drinking.

01:21:19.718 --> 01:21:20.718
Okay!

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.166
From now on, I won't drink.

01:21:23.846 --> 01:21:24.846
Okay?

01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:28.971
Hey, c'mon smile, smile.

01:21:30.062 --> 01:21:31.083
Daddy I love you.

01:21:34.903 --> 01:21:38.476
There's this fatso in our class.
Deven. He bullies everyone around.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:43.953
He snatched Prakash's lunch box
away. I complained to the teacher.

01:21:44.034 --> 01:21:46.872
Why complain? Box him in
the stomach. That'll do him right.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.248
-Well, what will you do to him?
-I'll box him in the stomach.

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:51.380
C'mon now give daddy big hug.

01:22:01.107 --> 01:22:03.142
Go on now. I'll be
back to take you home.

01:22:15.571 --> 01:22:16.571
Rohit.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.133
I was passing by when
I saw the two of you.

01:22:27.826 --> 01:22:29.325
Sonu was looking quite cheerful.

01:22:35.009 --> 01:22:40.761
I'd thought I'd call
you up sometime.

01:22:42.132 --> 01:22:45.086
But I decided that it'd be
better if I met you personally.

01:22:51.087 --> 01:22:52.087
How are you?

01:22:54.976 --> 01:22:59.158
I'm fine, and I don't have much to
worry about. How have you been?

01:23:00.862 --> 01:23:06.977
Autograph please. Autograph please.

01:23:49.322 --> 01:23:50.322
Daddy!

01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:54.049
-Are you very forlorn, Daddy?
-No, I'm not. Why do you ask?

01:23:54.724 --> 01:23:58.177
Nothing particularly.
Are you thinking about Mummy?

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:02.160
Go to sleep now.

01:24:03.354 --> 01:24:04.354
Good night.

01:24:04.678 --> 01:24:06.014
Daddy I love you.

01:24:07.014 --> 01:24:08.014
I love you too.

01:24:12.065 --> 01:24:17.698
"My heart says, go, meet him!"

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:23.409
"I take a step;
I falter to a stop."

01:24:23.670 --> 01:24:29.304
"Sometimes my heart
reasons with me;"

01:24:29.656 --> 01:24:34.919
"sometimes I reason with my heart."

01:24:47.114 --> 01:24:52.616
"My heart says, go, meet him!"

01:24:52.871 --> 01:24:58.297
"I take a step;
I falter to a stop."

01:24:58.702 --> 01:25:04.293
"Sometimes my heart
reasons with me;"

01:25:04.537 --> 01:25:09.975
"sometimes I reason with my heart."

01:25:45.983 --> 01:25:56.913
"How long we've been separated,
my beloved!"

01:25:57.515 --> 01:26:08.658
"You look at me so and
my intentions are as nothing."

01:26:09.313 --> 01:26:19.535
"The moon's wealth lies
in the moonlight's fame."

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:25.227
"But since losing you
it has seemed to me that

01:26:25.902 --> 01:26:30.858
if you're not here,
there's nothing else (to life)."

01:26:32.347 --> 01:26:37.700
"Do you know now how much,

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:43.559
in my heart of hearts, I regret?"

01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:49.343
"Sometimes my heart
reasons with me;"

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:55.143
"sometimes I reason with my heart."

01:27:45.623 --> 01:27:55.547
"How beautiful were those
days when we were together,

01:27:57.398 --> 01:28:07.426
and your arms were
within my touch."

01:28:09.051 --> 01:28:19.187
"In you, beloved, and you alone,
are my day and night."

01:28:19.883 --> 01:28:25.166
"But you are so far above me,
my dearest darling."

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:30.976
"Now there is nothing binding us;"

01:28:31.867 --> 01:28:37.537
it's not possible to get you back."

01:28:37.697 --> 01:28:43.143
"Even thinking about it, I fret."

01:28:43.545 --> 01:28:49.167
"Sometimes my heart
reasons with me;"

01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:55.004
"sometimes I reason with my heart."

01:28:55.232 --> 01:29:00.924
"My heart says, go, meet him!"

01:29:01.218 --> 01:29:06.577
"I take a step;
I falter to a stop."

01:29:06.887 --> 01:29:12.811
"I take a step;
I falter to a stop."

01:29:25.618 --> 01:29:27.030
Mr. Kanahiya!

01:29:27.975 --> 01:29:29.407
Mr. Kanahiya!

01:29:30.133 --> 01:29:32.042
Mr. Kanahiya!

01:29:32.169 --> 01:29:33.956
-Take a look at this!
-What's up? -Read it!

01:29:34.108 --> 01:29:37.033
-Read? -Read it.. see who wrote it!
-One Pawan Malhotra.

01:29:37.115 --> 01:29:39.506
-The film director!
-Didn't he direct CHAHAT?

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.761
That's him all right!

01:29:40.841 --> 01:29:43.097
He has signed me up to score the
music for his forthcoming film.

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:46.140
-What are saying?! -Really?!
-Yes! And I can't believe it!

01:29:46.241 --> 01:29:48.995
Pawan Malhotra patted my
shoulder and said...

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:51.351
"You're a very talented fellow!
How come I didn't meet you before?"

01:29:51.584 --> 01:29:53.855
He liked my songs very much!

01:29:53.935 --> 01:29:56.320
Thank God for that. And
congratulations!

01:29:56.708 --> 01:29:57.951
Hey Moolchand!

01:29:59.057 --> 01:30:00.725
Take a look at this! Get that?!

01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:02.079
All right. Understood.

01:30:03.557 --> 01:30:06.490
So you've got money! When
are you going to pay me up?

01:30:06.576 --> 01:30:09.242
I haven't yet received money.
I've just signed the contract.

01:30:09.381 --> 01:30:12.000
I'll get the money soon. Let's
celebrate with tea for everyone.

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.881
-Very well... er... What do you mean?
-It's on me, of course.

01:30:13.961 --> 01:30:16.893
-You should've said so. Come on in.
-I'll have a cup of tea too!

01:30:17.238 --> 01:30:19.401
Sunil. Sunil, Sunil!

01:30:21.838 --> 01:30:24.603
Are you going to become
the greatest music director now?

01:30:24.897 --> 01:30:27.535
That I'll become. But, do you know
what I'm going to do before that?

01:30:27.698 --> 01:30:29.281
-What? -Your birthday is
coming up, isn't it. -Oh yes.

01:30:29.392 --> 01:30:32.017
-I'll get you a surprise gift
for your birthday. -Really?

01:30:32.113 --> 01:30:34.765
-Yes. -What's it going to be?
-How can I tell you about it now?

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:35.902
It's surprise.

01:30:35.982 --> 01:30:38.806
I know what! Isn't it something
I showed you the other day?

01:30:39.165 --> 01:30:39.948
Well

01:30:40.028 --> 01:30:41.283
Is it yellow in color?

01:30:42.221 --> 01:30:44.535
The battery operated car!

01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:48.604
I love you my dear,
I love you.

01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:50.080
Excuse me.

01:30:50.873 --> 01:30:53.153
-Where does Mr. Rohit Kumar live?
-I'm Rohit Kumar.

01:30:58.673 --> 01:31:00.079
Ms. Kiran has sent this for you.

01:31:00.424 --> 01:31:01.424
It's Mummy's car!

01:31:01.574 --> 01:31:04.647
Hey folks! Come on quick! Take a
look at this. It's my Mummy's car!

01:31:19.223 --> 01:31:20.223
What's it?

01:31:21.539 --> 01:31:23.289
It's a letter from Kiran.

01:31:24.116 --> 01:31:28.440
She wants to celebrate Sonu's
birthday. She has invited us over.

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:32.280
You'll go over, won't you?

01:31:37.449 --> 01:31:38.574
You should go, Rohit.

01:31:43.899 --> 01:31:46.857
Tell her that we will come. But,
there's no need to sent the car.

01:31:59.991 --> 01:32:01.026
Wow!

01:32:08.309 --> 01:32:09.934
You mustn't be naughty, Sonu.

01:32:10.594 --> 01:32:12.402
And you must speak to
everyone politely, understand?

01:32:13.237 --> 01:32:15.054
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes. Okay.

01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:17.881
If anyone offers you
anything to eat, don't be greedy.

01:32:18.536 --> 01:32:20.951
Refuse it politely. But if you must
have it, say thanks afterwards.

01:32:21.406 --> 01:32:22.500
Sonu has arrived.

01:32:24.365 --> 01:32:25.365
Sonu!

01:32:26.519 --> 01:32:27.519
Mom!

01:32:37.309 --> 01:32:38.309
Sonu!

01:32:43.786 --> 01:32:44.786
Sonu!

01:32:46.515 --> 01:32:47.791
-Hello, Kiran.
-Hi!

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:50.533
-I hope we aren't late.
-No problem.

01:32:51.015 --> 01:32:53.433
I was worried that
you wouldn't come.

01:32:53.649 --> 01:32:54.728
But, I have come.

01:32:55.614 --> 01:32:56.614
Madam.

01:32:57.645 --> 01:32:58.098
Thank you.

01:32:58.178 --> 01:32:59.178
Kiran!

01:32:59.712 --> 01:33:01.265
Cake, cake.

01:33:03.251 --> 01:33:06.337
Happy birthday to you

01:33:06.677 --> 01:33:09.657
Happy birthday to you

01:33:09.926 --> 01:33:13.090
Happy birthday dear Sonu

01:33:13.263 --> 01:33:16.309
Happy birthday to you

01:33:24.586 --> 01:33:25.700
Wow!

01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:50.773
Let me introduce you... my wife,
Lajwanti... and... Mrs. Tolaram.

01:33:50.957 --> 01:33:52.068
Hello!

01:33:57.143 --> 01:34:00.316
You are cheating cheating.
No, no.

01:34:04.357 --> 01:34:06.292
Sorry for leaving you
alone for a while.

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:08.678
Only a while, wasn't it?

01:34:11.551 --> 01:34:15.214
-I get childish when I'm with kids.
-You've always been childish.

01:34:15.864 --> 01:34:17.855
No Never.

01:34:19.576 --> 01:34:22.747
Sonu is still cheating at the
game. He's just like you!

01:34:26.204 --> 01:34:27.204
You're looking lovely.

01:34:28.194 --> 01:34:29.951
Oh really. Thank you.

01:34:30.606 --> 01:34:32.714
Come over here for a moment, Kiran.

01:34:33.897 --> 01:34:35.263
I'll be back in a moment.

01:34:37.535 --> 01:34:41.533
Won't you meet others around?
We have other guests too.

01:34:42.206 --> 01:34:44.923
Have you invited everyone to watch
you prancing with that fellow?

01:34:45.535 --> 01:34:49.505
I'll leave this
party if you speak so.

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:51.834
You must consider your status.

01:34:52.261 --> 01:34:55.952
-You're a star. And, journalists
are attending. -Who invited them?

01:34:56.653 --> 01:35:00.347
I wanted to celebrate a birthday.
You've made a circus out of it.

01:35:00.475 --> 01:35:03.611
Don't teach me what to
do and what not to.

01:35:04.246 --> 01:35:05.246
Hello.

01:35:06.437 --> 01:35:09.386
As of now, just stay away from
him. We have other guests here too.

01:35:10.321 --> 01:35:13.263
-Happy tidings, Mr. Ramdayal.
-Thank you.

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.350
-Happy tidings to you too.
-Thank you.

01:35:15.445 --> 01:35:17.051
-Hello. Hi.
-Excuse me.

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.785
-What's up? Any problem?
-Nothing at all.

01:35:28.746 --> 01:35:30.816
They might not have taken a
liking to my presence.

01:35:35.219 --> 01:35:39.381
-I should've sent Sonu here alone.
-But why? I wanted you to come too.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.327
I wanted all of us to
celebrate Sonu's birthday together.

01:35:43.301 --> 01:35:45.448
I've taken a lot of pains
to organize this party.

01:35:45.687 --> 01:35:47.109
And now, these people...

01:35:49.056 --> 01:35:50.809
...they've spoilt my mood.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.920
It's okay.

01:35:55.944 --> 01:35:57.497
Mom! Save me.

01:35:57.984 --> 01:36:00.189
-Mom help me!
-Sonu!

01:36:00.715 --> 01:36:03.210
-I've asked you not to run around!
-Hey fatso! You won't catch me!

01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:05.623
-Let me go! He'll catch me!
-Let him.

01:36:05.743 --> 01:36:07.643
-I got caught because of you!
-That's just as well.

01:36:07.723 --> 01:36:09.456
Now you can sit
with Mummy for a while.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.100
My child!

01:36:13.284 --> 01:36:14.797
What's that mark?

01:36:15.101 --> 01:36:17.473
I was playing on the side.
And I fell down.

01:36:17.971 --> 01:36:19.737
-Oh no!
-And it bled a lot.

01:36:20.296 --> 01:36:22.905
-Did it take stitches?
-Yes 8 stitches.

01:36:23.636 --> 01:36:24.733
How did it happen?

01:36:24.976 --> 01:36:27.078
My mistake. I wasn't careful.

01:36:27.695 --> 01:36:29.939
And he didn't listen.

01:36:30.806 --> 01:36:33.607
It didn't hurt his eyes, thank God!
I could never have forgiven myself.

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:36.293
-And I didn't even cry.
-Really?

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:37.689
You are brave boy.

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.885
-Come on, Mummy. I want to
see your house. -Let's go.

01:36:41.176 --> 01:36:43.948
-Come along too, will you?
-No. Just go on. -All right.

01:36:49.384 --> 01:36:50.340
Thank you.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.816
-See you later.
-Excuse us.

01:36:55.427 --> 01:36:56.736
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

01:36:57.782 --> 01:37:01.169
-Have you had the cakes and other
goodies? -Yes I have, thank you.

01:37:02.102 --> 01:37:04.807
-Had enough?
-Not yet. I'll have some more.

01:37:09.641 --> 01:37:13.857
-Seen the villa?
-Yes. It's a huge one.

01:37:14.415 --> 01:37:17.256
It stretches right up to the beach.

01:37:17.353 --> 01:37:19.209
-There's a swimming pool back there.
-I see!

01:37:19.577 --> 01:37:22.453
-It cost a million bucks.
-Fantastic.

01:37:22.945 --> 01:37:25.933
Are you still at
song-and-dance at the hotel?

01:37:28.496 --> 01:37:29.481
Well, you see...

01:37:29.561 --> 01:37:32.523
-Glory be to The Divine mother.
-Greetings, Mr. Gulbadan Kumar.

01:37:32.614 --> 01:37:35.556
-Greetings. -Happy tidings
on your son's birthday.

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:40.320
I'm very upset with him, I am! Tell
me, is this any way to behave?!

01:37:40.584 --> 01:37:43.478
You're the sole object of discussion
in the film business nowadays.

01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.693
You are famous in
whole film industry.

01:37:46.936 --> 01:37:51.687
He has scored such lovely songs;
and he has put Amar Kaushik to shame!

01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:55.262
Well, you've become a very
important person nowadays.

01:37:55.342 --> 01:37:57.964
But you mustn't forget simple folks
like me. Do call up once in a while.

01:37:58.187 --> 01:38:03.021
-Never mind that. But you must get
me the music rights. -Sure.

01:38:03.104 --> 01:38:05.880
-Together, we'll make a stupendous
success out of it. -Surely.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.702
Divine Mother be praised!

01:38:08.571 --> 01:38:12.094
A heroine and a music
director in the family!

01:38:12.226 --> 01:38:16.234
No dearth of money! I suggest you
become a film producer. Say what?!

01:38:17.164 --> 01:38:20.050
-Excuse me.
-Oh yes. -Be back soon.

01:38:20.883 --> 01:38:25.262
-How many films have you signed?
-Just one till now.

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:31.914
You'll get many more, I'm sure.
But take care about signing films.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.341
What'd you like to have?
Whisky or rum?

01:38:34.676 --> 01:38:35.704
I've stopped drinking.

01:38:37.186 --> 01:38:40.252
May The Divine Mother bless you!
A Coca-cola for the gentleman, please.

01:38:40.357 --> 01:38:44.803
Hello there! Nowadays, you
don't seem to care for us.

01:38:44.883 --> 01:38:48.704
That isn't the case at all.
In fact, we were discussing you.

01:38:48.784 --> 01:38:52.797
After all, he has rising star
with him. Mr. Rohit Kumar!

01:38:53.096 --> 01:38:55.758
The singer and composer.
A two-in-one!

01:38:57.766 --> 01:38:58.766
Rohit!

01:38:59.162 --> 01:39:00.162
Rohit cheers.

01:39:00.315 --> 01:39:04.631
Congratulations! So
even you've got a film!

01:39:05.707 --> 01:39:09.637
What I don't understand is
how he bagged the film.

01:39:10.957 --> 01:39:17.073
Because there still are people who
value caliber. Not names.

01:39:17.322 --> 01:39:21.866
I see! But I think that behind
every successful man lies a woman.

01:39:22.114 --> 01:39:27.572
But slightly different in this case;
a successful woman behind the man!

01:39:29.939 --> 01:39:35.657
-What do you mean? -Can a woman
who is beautiful and successful...

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.964
...not do as much for her husband?
-Surely she can do!

01:39:40.044 --> 01:39:43.861
-What nonsense are you speaking?
-Do you think Pawan Malhotra has...

01:39:44.004 --> 01:39:46.080
...signed you because he
likes your rotten songs?

01:39:46.343 --> 01:39:53.439
-We were supposed to sign this film.
-You've got it because of your wife.

01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:55.490
Don't believe it, d'you?

01:39:55.681 --> 01:39:58.846
Why! It's commonplace.
Come here, Mr. Tolaram.

01:39:59.283 --> 01:40:01.903
-Come here, Mr. Tolaram.
-What's up, gentlemen?

01:40:02.317 --> 01:40:04.225
Tell him... go on! Tell him how
he has landed this film.

01:40:04.387 --> 01:40:05.372
Oh forget it!

01:40:05.452 --> 01:40:10.421
-Go on, speak up. Tell him!
-He has scored some very good songs.

01:40:10.525 --> 01:40:13.796
To hell with the songs!
You had signed us.

01:40:13.926 --> 01:40:14.926
Well yes, I did...

01:40:15.078 --> 01:40:19.627
-On his wife's say-so, you threw us
out! Correct? -Nothing of the sort!

01:40:19.832 --> 01:40:23.260
-She had merely... -D'you
hear that, Mister two-in-one?

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:27.903
It happens dear. Everything
goes in this business.

01:40:28.395 --> 01:40:32.332
-People do use their good-looking
wives too. -Oh yes. They do.

01:40:39.585 --> 01:40:40.829
Listen!

01:40:41.108 --> 01:40:43.783
Look... look at what's going on
over there. Go on... over there.

01:40:44.105 --> 01:40:45.141
Leave me.

01:40:47.184 --> 01:40:50.689
Someone bashes me up... and you're
trying to patch up! What's going on?

01:40:51.335 --> 01:40:56.362
That's true! He couldn't
cook anything. Not even eggs!

01:40:56.489 --> 01:40:59.347
-Really?! How is it now? -Nowadays
he has picked up a few things.

01:40:59.434 --> 01:41:02.040
-He makes a dish out of potatoes
now and then. -Of potatoes?! -Yes.

01:41:02.426 --> 01:41:05.801
Sometimes, there are excess of
turmeric in it. But, I make do.

01:41:07.368 --> 01:41:08.885
Oh hello, Rohit. Come in.

01:41:09.303 --> 01:41:10.303
Go downstairs, Sunil.

01:41:10.411 --> 01:41:11.809
One minute please,
daddy, I want to tell mummy...

01:41:11.889 --> 01:41:13.401
I asked you to go downstairs!

01:41:15.571 --> 01:41:16.673
What's up, Rohit?

01:41:19.037 --> 01:41:20.449
Wait for me downstairs.

01:41:24.539 --> 01:41:26.451
Did you speak to Pawan
Malhotra about me?

01:41:27.951 --> 01:41:30.475
Did you ask him to replace me with
Amar Kaushik as a music director?

01:41:31.567 --> 01:41:33.704
-Why are you asking me this?
-Did you tell him, or, didn't you?

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.162
Give me an answer, Kiran.

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:40.694
Yes.

01:41:43.712 --> 01:41:46.263
-Why?
-Because I wanted to help you.

01:41:46.689 --> 01:41:49.366
I don't want your help!
I don't want anyone's help!

01:41:49.743 --> 01:41:53.380
-Won't I succeed without your help?
-That's not the case, Rohit.

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.282
D'you want to prove that you're
so big that you can make anyone?

01:41:57.752 --> 01:42:00.778
I've never thought of it that
way, Rohit. I did it because...

01:42:00.864 --> 01:42:02.909
...I know that you can score
better music than those fellows.

01:42:03.462 --> 01:42:05.752
That's what I wanted
to prove on my own.

01:42:06.616 --> 01:42:08.195
And now, you've spoiled everything.

01:42:09.348 --> 01:42:12.556
People will say that I've succeeded
because my wife helped me.

01:42:13.165 --> 01:42:14.998
My success will never be mine!

01:42:17.251 --> 01:42:21.254
-I can't do it! -Tell Pawan
Malhotra that I won't do this film!

01:42:21.337 --> 01:42:24.474
Don't lose your head, Rohit.
Pawan Malhotra liked your music.

01:42:24.717 --> 01:42:27.726
That's why he has signed you.
I haven't forced him to.

01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:31.510
What does it matter if a few
people tell you a lot of nonsense?

01:42:32.546 --> 01:42:36.111
I'm your wife. If I don't
help you, who else will?

01:42:37.502 --> 01:42:40.667
I see! So can you walk out on me,
or come to my aid at your sweet will?

01:42:41.592 --> 01:42:45.860
You don't want to help me. You just
want to show off your magnanimity.

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:47.502
You want to show me how
small I am, compared to you.

01:42:47.701 --> 01:42:50.043
And you want to show your concern
for me though you live apart.

01:42:58.028 --> 01:43:01.743
You've always thought ill of me.
You've always got me wrong.

01:43:01.823 --> 01:43:03.321
Why must I try to understand
you in the first place?

01:43:04.424 --> 01:43:06.828
I don't want to understand you.
Nor do I want to see you ever!

01:43:06.945 --> 01:43:08.729
Don't ever try to meet me again!

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.852
Stop! Rohit!

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.772
-Don't step inside this house ever!
-Listen to me! Please!

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:22.012
Come to your senses!

01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.942
How did all this come here?

01:43:38.265 --> 01:43:41.327
Look, Daddy! My birthday
presents! Mummy sent these over.

01:43:43.752 --> 01:43:47.610
This is a military jeep. It
turns around whenever it collides.

01:43:49.318 --> 01:43:51.857
Look! Here's a remote control car.

01:43:55.710 --> 01:43:58.998
Why can't we live in Mummy's house?

01:44:01.742 --> 01:44:03.289
Don't you like this house?

01:44:03.917 --> 01:44:06.410
-This home is fine, but...
-What of it?

01:44:06.919 --> 01:44:09.620
But her house is so
big... and it's so nice.

01:44:10.018 --> 01:44:13.839
She has 3 TV sets.
We don't have a single one.

01:44:20.688 --> 01:44:22.683
What did Mummy tell you
at this party yesterday?

01:44:23.821 --> 01:44:26.387
She said that she
loves me very much.

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:28.758
What did you tell her?

01:44:29.193 --> 01:44:32.332
That she's the best Mummy on earth.

01:44:35.746 --> 01:44:38.255
So now you want to
live with Mummy, do you?

01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:45.215
-I'm asking you something.
-Do you know something?

01:44:45.459 --> 01:44:48.726
Mummy is going to buy the
battery-operated car for me.

01:44:49.164 --> 01:44:53.137
-Did you ask her for it?
-No, I just told her that I like it.

01:44:53.274 --> 01:44:55.771
She said that she'd buy it for me.

01:44:56.013 --> 01:44:58.787
Why did you have to ask her for it?
I was supposed to buy it for you.

01:45:00.144 --> 01:45:04.539
-You haven't got it yet.
-But I was to get it for your birthday.

01:45:05.009 --> 01:45:07.400
-And now, my birthday is gone.
-All right. I know that.

01:45:10.935 --> 01:45:13.241
I'll get you that car today.

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:15.927
-Promise?
-Promise.

01:45:16.104 --> 01:45:17.988
Understood? I'll get
it today! For you.

01:45:18.136 --> 01:45:19.918
My car is coming today!

01:45:32.188 --> 01:45:36.965
-How much does that car cost?
-5000 Rupees. -5000?! -Yes.

01:45:37.967 --> 01:45:41.185
-It's a bit too much for that car.
-Fixed price. Take it or leave it.

01:45:42.286 --> 01:45:45.095
-An advance of 5000 Rupees?!
-I need the money, Sir.

01:45:45.623 --> 01:45:50.192
So you need all of 5000 Rupees!
D'you hear that, Mr. Godwill?

01:45:51.329 --> 01:45:53.296
You may deduct a thousand rupees
every month out of my salary.

01:45:53.478 --> 01:45:57.029
-It'd be adjusted within 5 months.
-Will you be here for 5 months?

01:45:57.685 --> 01:46:00.645
Seems like you've got a chance
to sing in some third rate film.

01:46:00.774 --> 01:46:02.499
And now, you're looking for
chance to give me the slip.

01:46:02.594 --> 01:46:03.686
No, Sir.

01:46:04.893 --> 01:46:07.154
That isn't the case at all!
I've forgotten these dreams.

01:46:07.717 --> 01:46:11.334
The only person I have to
myself is my 6 year old son.

01:46:13.043 --> 01:46:17.263
Yesterday was his birthday.
And I had promised him a gift.

01:46:17.687 --> 01:46:20.263
A gift... worth 5000 bucks!

01:46:23.382 --> 01:46:27.229
D'you hear that. Mr. Godwill?! I've
never given a single gift to my son.

01:46:27.351 --> 01:46:29.923
And my good man wants to give a
gift worth 5000 bucks to his son!

01:46:32.768 --> 01:46:39.012
You've spun a good spiel. But, I'm
not one to be taken in my your story.

01:46:39.281 --> 01:46:42.525
-Please try to understand...
-Don't waste my time. And back to work!

01:46:44.726 --> 01:46:47.399
Let's get working. We don't have
a circus happening here, do we?

01:46:51.126 --> 01:46:53.431
-So you won't let me have the
money will you? -Not at all.

01:46:56.579 --> 01:46:59.500
What are you doing?! I'll call
the police! Stop him, Godwill!

01:47:00.001 --> 01:47:01.485
What hooliganism is this?

01:47:01.886 --> 01:47:04.607
Waiter, waiter, waiter look.

01:47:04.694 --> 01:47:05.694
Put it down on my account.

01:47:07.138 --> 01:47:08.138
Stop him!

01:47:11.049 --> 01:47:12.110
Catch him!

01:47:24.354 --> 01:47:26.837
Snatch the money from him!

01:47:47.303 --> 01:47:50.963
Know something, aunt Farida? Daddy
is getting me a battery-powered car.

01:47:51.319 --> 01:47:53.345
Is that so? That's
good news, I say.

01:47:54.352 --> 01:47:56.632
It's getting late.
Time to have dinner.

01:47:57.601 --> 01:48:00.268
I won't eat now.
I'll eat when Daddy comes home.

01:48:00.413 --> 01:48:01.526
No knowing when he'll return.

01:48:01.824 --> 01:48:03.525
I must go home and get my
kids to do their homework.

01:48:03.786 --> 01:48:06.853
-Go on... eat your dinner quickly.
-No. I won't eat now.

01:48:07.976 --> 01:48:10.753
Very well. I'm leaving the food
here. Eat it when you feel hungry.

01:49:01.068 --> 01:49:02.068
Daddy!

01:49:04.361 --> 01:49:07.091
When did you return?
I didn't even get to know!

01:49:13.009 --> 01:49:14.766
Where's the car, Daddy?

01:49:16.394 --> 01:49:20.754
-Why haven't you eaten yet?
-I was waiting for you.

01:49:21.994 --> 01:49:25.480
You mustn't stay awake so
late. I don't like this at all.

01:49:26.122 --> 01:49:30.327
I was waiting so we
could eat together.

01:49:49.713 --> 01:49:50.713
I'm sorry Sonu.

01:49:51.789 --> 01:49:52.789
I'm sorry.

01:49:53.508 --> 01:49:58.279
-What's happened, Daddy?
-I lost my son. I have lost.

01:50:00.391 --> 01:50:01.661
Don't cry.

01:50:02.555 --> 01:50:07.327
-Please don't cry, Daddy.
-My son asked me for only one thing.

01:50:08.293 --> 01:50:09.817
And I couldn't get it for him.

01:50:12.869 --> 01:50:14.558
This is the worst
defeat in my life.

01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:19.628
I don't want that car, Daddy.
Really... I don't want it.

01:50:23.547 --> 01:50:25.335
No, no.

01:50:37.771 --> 01:50:42.705
Here... I have some money.
And I'm going to get more.

01:50:44.724 --> 01:50:48.192
And I'm going to
get that car for you.

01:50:49.528 --> 01:50:50.413
I love you.

01:50:50.493 --> 01:50:51.686
I love you to Daddy.

01:50:52.758 --> 01:50:55.576
But, please stop
drinking, Daddy. Please.

01:50:59.154 --> 01:51:06.071
I'll get that car
for you, Sonu. I will.

01:51:07.271 --> 01:51:09.880
Sonu.. I love you, Sonu.

01:51:11.373 --> 01:51:12.884
I love you.

01:51:34.405 --> 01:51:35.405
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

01:51:35.502 --> 01:51:37.938
-Mr. Pawan Malhotra has summoned
me here. -Please follow me.

01:51:45.742 --> 01:51:49.153
Please forgive me, Rohit. I've had
you summoned here using the alias.

01:51:50.682 --> 01:51:52.165
Else, you wouldn't have come.

01:51:52.838 --> 01:51:54.412
I want to discuss something.

01:51:55.852 --> 01:51:57.388
Is anything worth discussing?

01:51:57.838 --> 01:51:59.889
Please sit down, Rohit.

01:52:06.165 --> 01:52:09.735
You had told me something the other
day. All I want to know is whether...

01:52:12.063 --> 01:52:14.722
...it is your final decision.
-Why?

01:52:15.586 --> 01:52:17.985
Are you still firm about
not meeting me ever again?

01:52:20.638 --> 01:52:21.638
Absolutely.

01:52:24.416 --> 01:52:28.808
-In that ease, I want my son.
-What was it you said?!

01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:34.004
-I want Sonu to live with me.
-You want Sonu! Incredible!

01:52:34.259 --> 01:52:38.186
How could you even think of it?
You left him when he needed you.

01:52:38.551 --> 01:52:41.060
-D'you want me to... -You haven't
seen him in a year and a half.

01:52:41.263 --> 01:52:44.292
You haven't even asked if he's dead
or alive. And now you want him!

01:52:44.746 --> 01:52:46.508
Sonu needs me.

01:52:46.818 --> 01:52:48.983
-He'll be happy with me.
-And, isn't he happy with me?

01:52:49.825 --> 01:52:53.622
Now wait a minute! D'you mean to
say that I can't keep him happy?

01:52:53.744 --> 01:52:57.123
-I didn't say so. -D'you think
you can give him more happiness...

01:52:57.248 --> 01:52:59.748
...because you're wealthy?

01:52:59.894 --> 01:53:01.455
-Please don't shout, Rohit.
-Why mustn't I!

01:53:01.601 --> 01:53:03.201
I don't care for your society.

01:53:03.797 --> 01:53:07.612
I'm his mother.
And you can't deny my right.

01:53:07.803 --> 01:53:09.339
Neither can you mine!

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:12.398
I'm his father.
And he stays with me.

01:53:15.262 --> 01:53:17.400
I'd even go to court to get Sonu.

01:53:29.572 --> 01:53:31.839
Well, how do I play that?
Just like Daddy, don't I?

01:53:40.803 --> 01:53:43.132
I'm sorry for having
touched the piano, Daddy.

01:53:54.227 --> 01:53:57.300
In terms of this notice, Ms.
Kiran seeks a divorce from you.

01:53:57.965 --> 01:54:00.285
And, she wants that the child
be placed in her custody.

01:54:03.139 --> 01:54:04.334
All I want is my son.

01:54:05.114 --> 01:54:10.243
I'll tell you something
before I take the case.

01:54:10.745 --> 01:54:14.027
In such cases, the decision
generally favors the mother.

01:54:14.232 --> 01:54:16.371
I have been parenting him
for nearly two years now.

01:54:16.566 --> 01:54:19.502
-She had abandoned the child.
-Yet, Ms. Kiran remains the mother.

01:54:20.082 --> 01:54:22.814
Besides, she's a successful woman.
You don't have a job. That's worse.

01:54:22.984 --> 01:54:23.971
-Sir.
-Yes.

01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:25.250
Mane sir has send file.

01:54:26.184 --> 01:54:27.605
Here is no signature
Go and get signature.

01:54:27.745 --> 01:54:29.414
-And give that file also.
-Yes sir.

01:54:29.592 --> 01:54:35.966
You'd have to pay for court fees and
mine to the extent of 50 or 60,000.

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:39.786
That's irrespective of whether you
win or lose. D'you have the money?

01:54:42.989 --> 01:54:47.224
-Yes. Please prepare the brief.
-Very well.

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:50.974
You may come here on Wednesday
at 10 am. We'll discuss the case.

01:54:51.327 --> 01:54:55.027
Please bring 20,000 towards
expenses in advance All right.

01:54:57.613 --> 01:54:58.613
Yes.

01:55:06.034 --> 01:55:08.897
I can pay 15,000 for
all these instruments.

01:55:09.043 --> 01:55:10.883
15000 only! How come?!

01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:14.089
The piano is worth at least
20,000. I'd bought it for 30,000.

01:55:14.687 --> 01:55:17.007
I should get at least 40,000
for all the instruments.

01:55:17.286 --> 01:55:20.121
This is business for me. I should
be able to earn a bit out of this.

01:55:22.648 --> 01:55:28.158
-Well, give me at least 25,000.
-I can't pay more than 15,000.

01:55:28.238 --> 01:55:30.685
-Very well, you may leave.
-You seem to be cross with me, Sir.

01:55:30.765 --> 01:55:33.456
We don't want to sell.
Now, please leave.

01:55:33.564 --> 01:55:34.907
It's yours, do as you please.

01:55:34.987 --> 01:55:36.554
-Please leave.
-Excuse me, gentleman.

01:55:36.942 --> 01:55:39.995
What a waste of time!
Why did they call me at all?

01:55:41.352 --> 01:55:44.747
Have you gone out of your mind?
Can a junk dealer appreciate these?

01:55:45.693 --> 01:55:49.958
You're worrying for nothing. Sell
my furniture to raise the money.

01:55:53.044 --> 01:55:56.527
No. You've already
done so much for me.

01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.947
-I'll sell my songs.
-Sell your songs?!

01:56:01.283 --> 01:56:03.835
-To whom?
-To Amar Kaushik.

01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:05.916
You've really gone
out of your mind.

01:56:07.395 --> 01:56:09.718
He's willing to pay
me 1000 for every song.

01:56:10.068 --> 01:56:11.407
Who gets the credit?

01:56:12.123 --> 01:56:15.634
-They get the credits.
-You mustn't do such a thing.

01:56:16.569 --> 01:56:20.038
These are fruits of your labor.
They're your hopes, your dreams.

01:56:21.272 --> 01:56:23.449
How can you give
that away to someone?

01:56:25.529 --> 01:56:30.008
Your songs are beautiful, Rohit.
You must get credit for these songs.

01:56:31.952 --> 01:56:34.687
That's what I thought too.
I thought my songs were beautiful.

01:56:35.893 --> 01:56:39.164
But, I've tried for so many years.
And, no one seems to like them.

01:56:40.209 --> 01:56:42.097
And, at long last, I think
I have been entirely wrong.

01:56:42.389 --> 01:56:44.814
-My songs might really be worthless.
-I don't agree to that.

01:56:45.245 --> 01:56:51.202
-You're making a big mistake, Rohit.
-I may be. But, if in exchange...

01:56:51.621 --> 01:56:56.800
...for these, I can have Sonu,
then these songs are priceless.

01:56:59.075 --> 01:57:01.011
Else, these are no more
than scribbling on paper.

01:57:25.298 --> 01:57:28.113
"Why did you break my heart?"

01:57:29.495 --> 01:57:32.171
"Why did you fallen in love?"

01:57:33.693 --> 01:57:38.885
"Why did you go away.
Away away away away."

01:57:39.735 --> 01:57:43.411
"Why did you steal my heart"

01:57:43.834 --> 01:57:47.582
"when you had to break it?"

01:57:48.148 --> 01:57:51.679
"Why did you fall in love with me"

01:57:52.268 --> 01:57:56.266
"when you had to spurn me?"

01:57:56.488 --> 01:57:59.759
"Why did you steal my heart"

01:58:00.612 --> 01:58:04.124
"when you had to break it?"

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:08.443
"Why did you fall in love with me"

01:58:09.046 --> 01:58:13.046
"when you had to spurn me?"

01:58:13.457 --> 01:58:16.390
"Why did you break my heart?"

01:58:17.628 --> 01:58:20.599
"Why did you fallen in love?"

01:58:21.814 --> 01:58:26.985
"Why did you go away.
Away away away away."

01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:48.680
"You taught my heart how to beat;"

01:58:49.063 --> 01:58:52.841
"you taught my heart
how to writhe in pain."

01:58:53.178 --> 01:58:57.172
"Somehow tears stayed
hidden in my eyes;"

01:58:57.447 --> 01:59:01.596
"you taught them how to brim over."

01:59:07.495 --> 01:59:10.960
"Why did you settle into my breast"

01:59:11.804 --> 01:59:15.419
"when you had to
toy with my heart?"

01:59:16.041 --> 01:59:19.512
"Why did you fall in love with me"

01:59:20.207 --> 01:59:24.262
"when you had to spurn me?"

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:28.394
"Why did you steal my heart?"

01:59:28.845 --> 01:59:31.738
"Why did you break my heart?""

01:59:32.988 --> 01:59:35.776
"Why did you fallen in love?"

01:59:37.138 --> 01:59:42.447
"Why did you go away.
Away away away away."

02:00:03.592 --> 02:00:08.235
"Whenever our gazes met,"

02:00:08.661 --> 02:00:12.544
"it was like flames
rose from my heart."

02:00:12.762 --> 02:00:16.721
"From my breath something
drifted out like smoke;"

02:00:17.005 --> 02:00:21.097
"it was made from me,
neither living nor dying."

02:00:27.202 --> 02:00:30.884
"Why did you set me on fire when"

02:00:31.146 --> 02:00:34.857
"you'd have to extinguish
and forsake my heart?"

02:00:35.529 --> 02:00:39.292
"Why did you fall in love with me"

02:00:39.661 --> 02:00:43.828
"when you'd have to spurn me?"

02:00:43.983 --> 02:00:47.784
The filmfare award for the Best
music director, this year for...

02:00:48.033 --> 02:00:54.316
...the song DIL MERA CHURAYA
KYON goes to Amar Kaushik.

02:01:43.479 --> 02:01:45.277
Yes, Mr. Bhokwani.
You may proceed.

02:01:45.388 --> 02:01:49.478
Mr. Rohit Kumar's attorney
has sent me this letter today.

02:01:50.074 --> 02:01:54.414
He has agreed to divorce Ms. Kiran.

02:01:54.908 --> 02:01:58.800
But he has refused the prayer to
place Ms. Kiran's son Sunil Kumar...

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:01.637
...under her custody.

02:02:02.649 --> 02:02:05.381
The case therefore rests
upon the contention...

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:07.308
...as to who may have custody of
the child.

02:02:08.101 --> 02:02:10.736
Before arguing the case
I'll present some witnesses.

02:02:11.283 --> 02:02:12.870
This lawyer is a tough one.

02:02:13.946 --> 02:02:17.298
I shall speak the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

02:02:17.437 --> 02:02:22.089
Can you tell the court something
about your daughter, Mrs. Ramdayal?

02:02:22.992 --> 02:02:25.720
My daughter is a simple girl, and
has all the qualities of a girl...

02:02:26.190 --> 02:02:32.270
...who has had a respectable
upbringing. She's an obedient girl.

02:02:32.711 --> 02:02:35.921
Why then, did she marry Rohit
Kumar against your wishes?

02:02:37.090 --> 02:02:40.568
That's the only mistake she
has committed in all her life.

02:02:41.828 --> 02:02:44.534
And, she's still
suffering for her mistake.

02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:50.338
This man had treated
her so cruelly that...

02:02:51.307 --> 02:02:54.161
...she was forced to leave
his house at midnight.

02:02:55.953 --> 02:02:57.816
Thank you Mrs. Ramdayal.
You may step down.

02:02:58.755 --> 02:03:03.067
Can you tell the court about Rohit
Kumar's character, Mr. Ramdayal?

02:03:03.676 --> 02:03:07.722
What can I say about a
man who has no character?

02:03:08.418 --> 02:03:12.443
He's a scoundrel; and he's wayward.
You mustn't consider his appearance.

02:03:12.903 --> 02:03:15.505
He inveigled my daughter using
those looks, and with his words.

02:03:15.819 --> 02:03:18.115
-Really?! -He claimed to be
a singer of great caliber.

02:03:18.570 --> 02:03:20.309
And he said that he was going to
become a famous music director.

02:03:20.645 --> 02:03:22.963
He's still where he was.
And look at my daughter!

02:03:23.059 --> 02:03:25.789
She came out, and now, she's so
successful. And we don't want...

02:03:25.891 --> 02:03:28.577
...Sonu to live with him,
because the boy will turn wayward.

02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:30.391
Thank you,
Mr. Ramdayal.

02:03:33.796 --> 02:03:37.732
Has Rohit Kumar ever shied away
from fulfilling his responsibilities?

02:03:38.075 --> 02:03:40.744
-No. -Has he ever tried to
shirk responsibility? -No.

02:03:40.972 --> 02:03:44.805
-Has he been negligent
towards his son? -Never.

02:03:45.457 --> 02:03:47.977
In fact, he spends
most of his time with his son.

02:03:48.396 --> 02:03:51.912
He plays with the boy;
amuses him;...

02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:57.029
...reads stories to him and takes
him outdoors. Sunil is his very life.

02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:02.851
I've seen very few fathers who
would do as much for their children.

02:04:04.683 --> 02:04:06.201
Thank you very much, Mrs. Farida.

02:04:06.303 --> 02:04:08.334
That's all your honour.
Your witness Mr. Bhojwani.

02:04:12.206 --> 02:04:13.206
Farida.

02:04:13.842 --> 02:04:16.304
For how many years
have you known Mrs. Kiran?

02:04:16.767 --> 02:04:18.049
Some 7 years now.

02:04:18.261 --> 02:04:19.261
Good.

02:04:19.458 --> 02:04:23.759
Has Ms. Kiran ever told
you about her personal life?

02:04:23.842 --> 02:04:24.842
I objection mylord.

02:04:25.039 --> 02:04:28.518
Questions about Ms. Kiran's personal
life may be addressed to her only.

02:04:28.615 --> 02:04:29.615
Overruled

02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:33.103
Did she tell you anything about
her personal life.

02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:35.622
-Yes. -What?

02:04:39.264 --> 02:04:42.557
-She was unhappy.
-With whom was she unhappy?

02:04:44.708 --> 02:04:48.946
-She was unhappy about Rohit.
-Did Ms. Kiran ever tell you...

02:04:49.026 --> 02:04:52.246
...that Rohit Kumar doesn't
care about his son at all?

02:04:59.033 --> 02:05:01.206
Please reply, Ms. Farida.
I haven't yet heard you.

02:05:03.143 --> 02:05:05.081
Yes. But, that had
happened before Kiran left.

02:05:05.172 --> 02:05:06.545
Maybe. But he...

02:05:06.649 --> 02:05:10.823
...didn't care about his son at all.
Now, Ms. Farida, can you tell me...

02:05:11.216 --> 02:05:17.168
...if you ever advised Ms. Kiran
to break away? -No. I did not.

02:05:19.941 --> 02:05:23.570
3 days before she walked out,
did you not tell her that:

02:05:23.902 --> 02:05:29.000
"If you are so unhappy, it'd
be better for you to leave"?

02:05:29.901 --> 02:05:32.142
Yes. But I never thought that she'd
really do something like that.

02:05:32.272 --> 02:05:38.424
"If you are so unhappy, it'd be
better for you to leave Rohit"

02:05:38.802 --> 02:05:43.195
Kiran was a good friend. And, I was
concerned about her. I still am.

02:05:43.612 --> 02:05:48.738
-And whatever I told her...
-Was born out of your feeling that...

02:05:48.887 --> 02:05:52.503
...had Kiran lived on with Rohit,
she would've gone mad or could've...

02:05:52.768 --> 02:05:57.354
...had a nervous breakdown, or she
may have even been driven to suicide.

02:05:57.741 --> 02:06:01.475
-But I... -D'you want an innocent
child to live with such a man!

02:06:01.615 --> 02:06:02.615
That's all milord.

02:06:04.756 --> 02:06:08.511
You're making a big mistake, Kiran.
Rohit has changed completely.

02:06:08.734 --> 02:06:09.588
Order order.

02:06:09.668 --> 02:06:12.543
He is no more what he used to
be. Listen to me, Kiran. Please!

02:06:13.125 --> 02:06:18.597
Don't take Sonu away from Rohit.
He needs Sunil. Without him...

02:06:19.092 --> 02:06:21.269
-Order, order please!
-Please don't do this to him.

02:06:22.195 --> 02:06:25.011
If you do not step down, it will be
regarded as a contempt of this court.

02:06:31.083 --> 02:06:33.201
I can't quite understand how you're
going about this case, Mr. Bhatija.

02:06:33.445 --> 02:06:35.628
At this rate, we're going to
lose... out of the way, please.

02:06:36.222 --> 02:06:39.347
Our witnesses are saying the truth.
And her lawyer is twisting facts.

02:06:39.636 --> 02:06:44.431
D'you want me to tell lies too?
Must I stoop to Bhojwani's level?

02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:48.311
D'you want me to raise a stink
over Ms. Kiran's personal life?

02:06:48.774 --> 02:06:52.093
Am I to prove that she's deranged?
Must I accuse her of adultery?

02:06:52.332 --> 02:06:54.430
-But that isn't true!
-Are you concerned about the truth?

02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:57.526
Or, do you want your son? Tell me.
I'll handle the case accordingly.

02:06:57.667 --> 02:07:00.263
I can present false witnesses as
he does. Do you want me to do that?

02:07:02.491 --> 02:07:06.060
No. Do it honestly.

02:07:07.037 --> 02:07:08.037
I'm sorry.

02:07:12.003 --> 02:07:17.993
Look at her now. She has done well
for herself. She's the ideal woman.

02:07:18.309 --> 02:07:19.779
She is the ultimate woman.

02:07:20.039 --> 02:07:21.068
Thank you.

02:07:21.265 --> 02:07:22.287
Mr. Bhatiga.

02:07:22.771 --> 02:07:23.898
No question.

02:07:25.464 --> 02:07:26.464
My lord.

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:30.363
My next witness is
Mr. Moolchand Gangar.

02:07:34.748 --> 02:07:36.920
-Where did he transpire from?
-I have no idea.

02:07:37.377 --> 02:07:39.702
-Who is he?
-The grocer in my neighborhood.

02:07:40.682 --> 02:07:43.710
-We don't get along too well.
-You haven't told me about him.

02:07:45.148 --> 02:07:48.994
-Is your shop located under
Rohit Kumar's residence? -Exactly.

02:07:49.231 --> 02:07:51.439
In that case, you might be
knowing Rohit well.

02:07:52.050 --> 02:07:52.954
Very well indeed.

02:07:53.034 --> 02:07:57.413
-I've heard that he buys groceries
from your shop on credit. -Always.

02:07:57.643 --> 02:08:01.225
-He might also be settling
your dues. -No. -Doesn't he?!

02:08:01.448 --> 02:08:03.910
Why then do you still
let him enjoy your credit?

02:08:04.044 --> 02:08:07.110
I allow credits to everyone. You
buy from me and you get credit.

02:08:08.508 --> 02:08:11.813
Did you threaten to lodge a
complaint with the police, when...

02:08:11.893 --> 02:08:15.205
...he had gotten
drunk and beaten you up?

02:08:19.923 --> 02:08:24.475
If I told tales about your wife,
you would've bashed are up too.

02:08:24.770 --> 02:08:27.152
Does it mean that
you aren't a good man?

02:08:27.294 --> 02:08:31.172
It's not a question of being good
or bad. It's more a matter of intent.

02:08:31.623 --> 02:08:35.751
-Now, did he pay you up after
the incident? -No, he didn't.

02:08:35.965 --> 02:08:38.798
Now how does a man run his
household under the circumstances?

02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:40.572
How can such a person
look after his son?

02:08:40.770 --> 02:08:41.902
You mean his son, Sunil?

02:08:42.045 --> 02:08:46.414
-Yes. -He'd give his life for Sunil.
He loves his son very much.

02:08:46.494 --> 02:08:48.994
He loves his son more than
I can ever love my son.

02:08:49.074 --> 02:08:51.793
Love can't satiate hunger.

02:08:53.033 --> 02:08:56.919
And what can one who has wrecked
his home provide for his son?

02:08:57.078 --> 02:08:58.859
Rohit Kumar has not
wrecked his own family.

02:08:58.939 --> 02:09:03.472
It's she... that woman sitting over
there? She has wrecked the family!

02:09:04.591 --> 02:09:07.209
Please answer questions put to
you. Do not try to give a verdict.

02:09:07.357 --> 02:09:11.582
Forgive me if I have erred. This is
my first ever appearance in court.

02:09:11.943 --> 02:09:14.450
-I came here because he summoned me.
-You may leave now.

02:09:14.735 --> 02:09:18.442
What you say is true. I've hated
Rohit Kumar for not repaying me.

02:09:18.522 --> 02:09:20.861
I've even quarreled
with him for my money.

02:09:21.104 --> 02:09:24.164
But my money isn't the bone of
contention. This is about his son.

02:09:24.244 --> 02:09:29.513
You asked me what he'd do for his
son. Well, he has sold himself!

02:09:29.981 --> 02:09:33.515
It might be easy for Ms. Kiran
to foot the bill for this lawsuit.

02:09:33.673 --> 02:09:35.693
She's a famous heroine.
And she has loads of money.

02:09:35.922 --> 02:09:40.797
But, it wasn't easy for Rohit. Do
you know what he did for his son?

02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:46.666
He sold his life's savings...
his music... to Amar Kaushik.

02:09:47.046 --> 02:09:49.368
They are now taking
credit for his music.

02:09:53.648 --> 02:09:57.741
-Rohit Kumar must've told you that.
-No he didn't. But I know better.

02:09:57.932 --> 02:10:01.293
I've heard all his songs so often,
it's still coming out of my ears.

02:10:01.509 --> 02:10:06.133
The song "RAJ A KO RANI SE
PYAR HO GAYA"...it's Rohit's.

02:10:07.063 --> 02:10:11.997
I'm telling you the truth! The song
wasn't written by Amar Kaushik.

02:10:16.737 --> 02:10:17.737
Mrs. Kiran.

02:10:18.197 --> 02:10:22.614
-Do you love your son?
-Yes. I love him dearly.

02:10:22.786 --> 02:10:25.537
Why did you leave him?

02:10:26.631 --> 02:10:35.047
He used to think that I'll remain
a failure. It ruined my confidence.

02:10:37.328 --> 02:10:42.485
I became fatalistic
about my failures.

02:10:44.195 --> 02:10:47.804
I was confused, and
I started losing my confidence.

02:10:50.438 --> 02:10:54.466
I felt stifled and confused.
I was scared. And I left my home.

02:10:56.345 --> 02:11:06.502
Then, I'd thought it better for
Sunil's sake not to take him along.

02:11:06.809 --> 02:11:10.762
Why then do you seek
custody of your son now?

02:11:11.647 --> 02:11:23.401
I know I had deserted him. I can
never forgive myself for the mistake.

02:11:27.586 --> 02:11:33.445
But, the situation has changed.
And, I am confident of myself.

02:11:35.938 --> 02:11:41.877
I can look after Sonu very well.
After all I reared him for 5 years.

02:11:43.479 --> 02:11:46.356
Must my child be taken away from me
because I've been away for 2 years?

02:11:50.635 --> 02:11:51.935
He needs me now.

02:11:56.070 --> 02:11:59.384
But I don't say that he
doesn't need his father.

02:12:00.595 --> 02:12:05.367
But, he's still a child. He needs a
mother more than he needs a father.

02:12:08.423 --> 02:12:09.635
And, I'm his mother.

02:12:13.574 --> 02:12:15.275
I'm his mother!

02:12:22.942 --> 02:12:23.942
Thank you.

02:12:24.532 --> 02:12:25.532
That's all.

02:12:26.852 --> 02:12:27.852
Mrs. Kiran.

02:12:28.058 --> 02:12:30.742
You've spent nearly 6
years with your husband.

02:12:31.389 --> 02:12:35.021
-Has he ever manhandled you?
-No. He hasn't.

02:12:35.361 --> 02:12:37.133
-Did he use abusive language?
-No.

02:12:37.362 --> 02:12:38.986
Has he ever ill-treated your son?

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:41.062
No.

02:12:41.142 --> 02:12:43.866
-Do you regard your husband
to be a drunkard? -No.

02:12:44.236 --> 02:12:47.891
Has he ever had relations with other
women... in the nature of infidelity?

02:12:49.636 --> 02:12:54.774
-No. -Then, the reason for your
desertion becomes amply clear.

02:12:56.165 --> 02:13:02.753
With whom did you have the longest
lasting relationship before marriage?

02:13:04.308 --> 02:13:07.843
-With my parents. -And you spent
some 22 years with them. -Yes.

02:13:09.404 --> 02:13:11.994
But, you married Rohit Kumar
against their wishes. Right?

02:13:12.586 --> 02:13:14.268
Yes. That's because I loved Rohit.

02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:15.629
I see.

02:13:16.258 --> 02:13:19.902
With whom, apart your parents have
you shared the longest relationship?

02:13:22.354 --> 02:13:25.543
-With my son Sunil, I think.
-You spent 5 years with him.

02:13:25.879 --> 02:13:27.788
And you've met him
only once afterwards!

02:13:27.924 --> 02:13:30.605
Now consider your husband. Don't
you think you've shared a...

02:13:30.685 --> 02:13:32.226
...very long
relationship with him?

02:13:34.664 --> 02:13:36.391
I didn't hear you, Ms. Kiran.

02:13:38.718 --> 02:13:41.171
-Yes. -And how many years in all,
prior to your marriage...

02:13:41.251 --> 02:13:43.294
...and afterwards have you
shared this relationship with him?

02:13:45.415 --> 02:13:51.815
-Nearly 7 years. -7 years!
Which means that you have failed...

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:55.913
...to sustain a relationship by
marriage, a social institution...

02:13:56.063 --> 02:13:59.102
...that is held holy and of
irrevocable bondage in our culture!

02:13:59.182 --> 02:14:00.802
-Objection milord!
-Over ruled.

02:14:01.636 --> 02:14:04.872
-Please state your reply, Ms. Kiran.
-Tell us, Ms. Kiran...

02:14:05.014 --> 02:14:08.064
D'you agree that you've failed
to sustain the relationship.

02:14:09.353 --> 02:14:13.251
-No, I didn't fail. -Didn't you?!
Would you rate this as a success?

02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:18.386
-Your marriage is on the rocks.
-We have failed each other.

02:14:18.719 --> 02:14:21.279
Not "both of us", Ms. Kiran.
It's you. You have failed!

02:14:21.488 --> 02:14:23.595
You walked out on your husband.
He didn't.

02:14:23.868 --> 02:14:26.203
You failed the relationship.

02:14:28.904 --> 02:14:32.244
-It's the marriage which failed.
-Not the marriage. You failed!

02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:35.794
You've failed to sustain the most
precious relationship of your life.

02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.864
Is that true? Or, isn't it?

02:14:49.399 --> 02:14:52.724
-Say it aloud. I didn't hear you.
Is it true? Or, isn't it? -Yes.

02:14:53.354 --> 02:14:54.354
Your honour.

02:14:54.948 --> 02:14:57.680
She walked out on her
parents after 22 years.

02:14:58.157 --> 02:15:01.167
She walked out on her
husband for 7 years.

02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:06.453
What guarantee that she won't desert
her child after another 2 or 3 years?

02:15:33.008 --> 02:15:35.330
D'you think that your
case stands weakened now?

02:15:35.410 --> 02:15:36.993
-No comments please.
-One question.

02:15:37.203 --> 02:15:38.865
You haven't lost a single
suit till date, Mr. Bhojwani.

02:15:38.945 --> 02:15:41.849
-But it seems that you're going
to lose this one. -No comments please.

02:15:43.865 --> 02:15:44.865
Your honour.

02:15:46.737 --> 02:15:51.313
Generally, It's the woman who
is favored in disputes like this.

02:15:53.344 --> 02:15:56.152
That's because she's
a woman and a mother.

02:15:58.825 --> 02:16:01.489
But presently, the questions
revolve around the child.

02:16:03.438 --> 02:16:06.518
As I understand, this Court will
decide in the child's interest...

02:16:07.474 --> 02:16:10.691
...about what's good for Sunil.

02:16:12.818 --> 02:16:16.030
I've been looking after
him for nearly 2 years now.

02:16:17.153 --> 02:16:21.084
I've learnt something.
And, I have understood much.

02:16:23.795 --> 02:16:28.179
And slowly, I've understood what
it takes to be a good father.

02:16:29.891 --> 02:16:33.676
It takes patience. One needs to
spend a lot of time with the child.

02:16:35.152 --> 02:16:37.419
For hours, I've heard him
talk of strange fantasies.

02:16:37.947 --> 02:16:40.446
I'd get tired of listening to him.
But, I'd go on listening despite.

02:16:40.888 --> 02:16:42.705
One must reply to a thousand
questions he has to ask.

02:16:42.815 --> 02:16:46.667
One must be there with him whenever
need be, so he might not feel lonely.

02:16:50.481 --> 02:16:53.928
To do all that, one must love.

02:16:56.597 --> 02:17:04.885
And I don't know where it's written
that a woman can love more than a man.

02:17:08.052 --> 02:17:12.449
Must a mother always love the
child more than the father?

02:17:22.130 --> 02:17:25.840
I do not say that the child
cannot have a better upbringing.

02:17:27.704 --> 02:17:29.593
I've always tried my best.

02:17:32.081 --> 02:17:37.598
Sometimes I'd scold him and he'd
go to bed with a heavy heart.

02:17:40.089 --> 02:17:45.539
Up next morning, we'd have breakfast
together and we'd laugh and talk.

02:17:46.665 --> 02:17:48.366
It was all as if
nothing had happened.

02:17:49.709 --> 02:17:53.267
Later, I'd drop him to school.
And while returning from school...

02:17:53.741 --> 02:17:55.678
...he would tell me about what
had happened all day in school.

02:17:56.171 --> 02:17:57.921
We used to dine together.

02:17:59.718 --> 02:18:01.314
And afterwards
I'd tell him stories.

02:18:08.941 --> 02:18:13.747
We've created a world for ourselves.
And it took a lot of love to do that.

02:18:17.781 --> 02:18:22.464
If this is destroyed, we
can never build it again.

02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:33.841
Don't do this, Kiran.

02:18:36.767 --> 02:18:39.204
Please don't do this to me again.

02:18:50.246 --> 02:18:51.246
Rohit.

02:18:51.925 --> 02:18:59.490
You've told the court that it must
decide in the interest of your son.

02:19:00.037 --> 02:19:01.037
Yes.

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:05.814
Did you work at the Copper Chimney
restaurant when you met Ms. Kiran?

02:19:05.959 --> 02:19:08.412
-Yes,
-How much salary did you draw then?

02:19:09.252 --> 02:19:10.395
3000 Rupees a month.

02:19:10.973 --> 02:19:12.314
3000 Rupees a month.

02:19:12.974 --> 02:19:14.767
But, you were dismissed
from the job, weren't you?

02:19:14.847 --> 02:19:17.775
I wasn't dismissed. I left
that job of my own volition.

02:19:18.105 --> 02:19:19.390
You left the job!

02:19:19.521 --> 02:19:21.385
And I thought that people take...

02:19:21.465 --> 02:19:23.354
...on greater
responsibilities after marriage!

02:19:23.433 --> 02:19:24.857
I wanted to rise in life.

02:19:25.424 --> 02:19:26.547
I wanted to become
a successful singer.

02:19:26.722 --> 02:19:29.233
You must've received
several offers for singing.

02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:31.594
I did get an offer
from Amar Kaushik.

02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.352
From Amar Kaushik! Lovely!

02:19:34.921 --> 02:19:39.595
But I don't think you have sung
in any of his films. Or, have you?

02:19:40.555 --> 02:19:42.397
-I had dropped the film.
-Left that too!

02:19:42.638 --> 02:19:43.638
Why?

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.784
Differences had
cropped up between us.

02:19:47.864 --> 02:19:50.683
I see... differences! And
what did you do afterwards?

02:19:51.506 --> 02:19:53.050
I went back to the earlier job.

02:19:53.194 --> 02:19:55.219
-At Copper Chimney? -Yes.

02:19:55.770 --> 02:19:57.623
And how much salary were you paid?

02:20:01.806 --> 02:20:05.024
I didn't hear you, Mr. Rohit.
How much salary were you paid?

02:20:05.995 --> 02:20:09.946
-2500 rupees.
-2500?! Down from 3000 to 2500!

02:20:10.505 --> 02:20:16.625
You're the first person ever to
climb down the ladder to success.

02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:23.558
And I do not think it to
be in your son's interest.

02:20:24.018 --> 02:20:25.162
Anyway.

02:20:26.089 --> 02:20:34.868
On September 13, you tried to
rob 5000 rupees from the cashier.

02:20:35.001 --> 02:20:36.741
-Objection my lord.
-Overruled

02:20:36.821 --> 02:20:38.913
No. I didn't try to rob.
I was asking for a loan.

02:20:38.993 --> 02:20:42.822
You tried to take the money forcibly.
And when waiters in the restaurant...

02:20:42.902 --> 02:20:45.388
...tried to apprehend you,
you fought with them physically.

02:20:45.973 --> 02:20:47.925
I was merely taking a loan.
And I had intended to repay it.

02:20:48.005 --> 02:20:52.740
Not only fisticuffs. Furniture was
broken and the restaurant losses.

02:20:53.097 --> 02:20:57.678
For the crime, Mr. Rohit Kumar had
spend some time in a police-lockup.

02:20:57.818 --> 02:20:59.487
-Is it so, or, isn't it?
-Why don't you try to understand?

02:20:59.645 --> 02:21:02.744
Please reply to my question in
the affirmative or the negative.

02:21:02.942 --> 02:21:05.747
I'm trying to give a reply. And I can't
do that in a mere "yes" or "no".

02:21:06.031 --> 02:21:08.510
I was taking an advance. It was
to be deducted form my salary.

02:21:08.985 --> 02:21:12.782
My son had asked for gift on his
birthday. And, I promised the gift.

02:21:13.192 --> 02:21:16.424
Stop shouting! Else, this
court holds you for contempt.

02:21:17.946 --> 02:21:19.240
Mr. Bhojwani you may proceed.

02:21:20.034 --> 02:21:23.182
Were you confined in the
police lock up, or, weren't you?

02:21:25.518 --> 02:21:26.910
-Yes. I was confined.
-Good.

02:21:27.138 --> 02:21:34.304
-Now, do you consider yourself
to be a responsible father? -Yes.

02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:42.907
Was your son was about to lose an
eye because you were irresponsible?

02:21:42.987 --> 02:21:44.588
-Objection my lord.
-Overruled

02:21:44.668 --> 02:21:48.161
Was your son Sunil
about to lose an eye?

02:21:48.562 --> 02:21:50.289
He was playing in the park.
And he fell down.

02:21:50.369 --> 02:21:52.651
He fell down because
you were careless!

02:21:52.731 --> 02:21:57.302
-And he was about to lose on eye!
-It was an accident.

02:21:57.382 --> 02:22:00.855
-It could've happened to anyone.
-Didn't you tell Ms. Kiran that he...

02:22:00.935 --> 02:22:03.673
...fell down because
you were careless...

02:22:03.843 --> 02:22:06.365
...and that he was
about to lose an eye?

02:22:08.728 --> 02:22:11.410
Tell us, Mr. Rohit, is
it true? Or, isn't it?

02:22:16.197 --> 02:22:23.512
-Yes. -Do you concede that your son
could've lost an eye for your fault?

02:22:26.424 --> 02:22:27.907
Yes.
That's all your honour.

02:22:54.848 --> 02:22:57.418
I had no idea that my lawyer
would drag that into the court.

02:23:00.177 --> 02:23:02.223
He had asked me a lot of question.

02:23:03.573 --> 02:23:05.497
I had merely answered
his questions.

02:23:06.477 --> 02:23:09.041
I know you aren't at fault.

02:23:10.816 --> 02:23:14.370
Please believe me.
I didn't do it willingly.

02:23:15.284 --> 02:23:17.453
Rohit, Rohit please.

02:23:21.387 --> 02:23:25.230
After hearing the depositors made by
witnesses, this court has decided...

02:23:25.310 --> 02:23:28.995
...that the child Sunil Kumar be
placed under Mrs. Kiran's custody.

02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:34.913
Congratulations.

02:23:36.304 --> 02:23:37.573
Congratulations.

02:24:04.637 --> 02:24:06.797
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

02:24:07.591 --> 02:24:11.701
Vacations start from today.
It's a month long vacation!

02:24:12.012 --> 02:24:14.345
We'll go to Matheran during
the vacation, won't we?

02:24:15.737 --> 02:24:18.048
-Would you like an ice-cream?
-No. I want an ice-candy.

02:24:19.418 --> 02:24:20.418
Come on.

02:24:21.566 --> 02:24:24.880
Do you know something. Daddy? All
the kids in my class are going...

02:24:25.036 --> 02:24:27.037
...to Simla on a school trip.
But, I'm not going with them.

02:24:27.209 --> 02:24:32.464
I'll go to Matheran with you. We'll
have lots of fun out there, won't we?

02:24:35.573 --> 02:24:39.790
We'll fly kites over there. And
I'll carry the cricket kit with me too.

02:24:40.887 --> 02:24:45.862
"Believe this,
if tomorrow the whole world"

02:24:46.286 --> 02:24:50.006
"Does not stand by me"

02:24:51.446 --> 02:24:59.022
"Who then is the
companion of my journey?"

02:25:13.392 --> 02:25:14.392
Sonu!

02:25:15.666 --> 02:25:16.666
Yes.

02:25:16.888 --> 02:25:18.363
I want to tell you something.

02:25:31.210 --> 02:25:33.927
This is a present from me.
It's a seasoned ball.

02:25:34.444 --> 02:25:37.352
Do come over to play cricket.
We'll have a match.

02:25:37.576 --> 02:25:43.527
Oh yes. You'll play for my team.
And we'll beat the grocer's team.

02:25:43.761 --> 02:25:47.256
-Mr. Ramdayal called up to say
that the car is coming. -I see.

02:25:47.481 --> 02:25:48.730
Carry the luggage down.

02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:50.848
Let's go downstairs.

02:26:04.698 --> 02:26:10.233
Don't cry, Sonu. Come on. You'll
enjoy yourself at Mummy's house.

02:26:11.127 --> 02:26:12.776
You'll have lots
of toys over there.

02:26:13.673 --> 02:26:16.121
And I'll come down to see you too.

02:26:19.953 --> 02:26:20.999
C'mon cheer up.

02:26:22.045 --> 02:26:25.333
-Take him down, Farida. I'll be
with you in sometime. -Very well.

02:26:31.456 --> 02:26:32.784
Where's your bat, Sunil?

02:26:34.047 --> 02:26:35.997
Where's your bat?
He must've forgotten it.

02:26:36.155 --> 02:26:37.549
I'll fetch it.
-Come along, son.

02:27:36.408 --> 02:27:37.720
Sonu has gone downstairs.

02:27:39.092 --> 02:27:40.866
-I want to tell you something, Rohit.
-What?

02:27:46.303 --> 02:27:48.537
This is Sonu's bat.
He forgot to take it.

02:27:50.645 --> 02:27:52.415
I bought a full
cricket kit yesterday.

02:27:53.188 --> 02:27:55.234
Why?! Isn't this bat
good for him anymore?

02:27:55.808 --> 02:28:00.820
No. It's just that I remembered
that Sonu is fond of cricket.

02:28:01.463 --> 02:28:05.003
Not only that. I've bought him
all the toys he could ever want.

02:28:08.719 --> 02:28:12.123
I've made him a room that
looks just like the one here.

02:28:13.158 --> 02:28:15.279
The same bed; a small table;
and a similar cupboard.

02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.594
And I've painted the walls
the same shade of color.

02:28:22.837 --> 02:28:29.255
All because I want to
make Sonu feel at home.

02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:40.512
And then I realized
that this is his home.

02:28:43.741 --> 02:28:45.684
A few articles can't
make a home for anyone.

02:28:48.673 --> 02:28:53.023
Sonu stays here. This is his home.

02:29:19.833 --> 02:29:26.032
Over the past few days, our lives
and our sentiments were laid bare.

02:29:27.385 --> 02:29:30.850
You must've been hurt. I know that.

02:29:33.191 --> 02:29:36.982
And today I know that nothing
matters more than the relationship.

02:29:39.486 --> 02:29:43.810
I'm sorry for everything
that has happened.

02:29:48.363 --> 02:29:51.640
You're staying here,
Sonu... with your father.

02:29:57.806 --> 02:29:59.228
This is your home.

02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:07.391
Kiran..

02:30:12.430 --> 02:30:15.293
This is your home too.
