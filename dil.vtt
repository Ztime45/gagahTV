00:04:40.462 --> 00:04:41.549
Money!

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:45.379
Money! Money is coming in!

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:47.837
Money is coming from the top,
from the bottom!

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:49.074
Only money!

00:04:50.087 --> 00:04:51.545
The money is colour,
the money is beauty!

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.295
A man is nothing without money.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.795
Money, all over the place.
Money is raining.

00:05:00.587 --> 00:05:03.670
Soft money! What a money!

00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:05.712
Silky money! My money!
So much money.

00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:07.920
He is dreaming again.
- Money!

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.427
Why are you tearing the mattress?
Come to your senses.

00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:12.837
What are you doing? Bring some water.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.761
Money is raining?
- What are you doing?

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:18.212
Money!
- Come to your senses.

00:05:18.295 --> 00:05:21.254
Money!
- Come to your senses.

00:05:21.837 --> 00:05:24.420
The flood.

00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:26.004
Come to your senses.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.004
This is not money. It's just cotton.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.545
You have spoilt my lakhs of rupees.

00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:39.151
You already have lakhs of rupees.
How much more do you want?

00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:42.545
Crores.
I want to earn crores of rupees.

00:05:43.098 --> 00:05:46.605
You don't know what happens
to me when I see money.

00:05:46.897 --> 00:05:50.397
I feel ecstatic when I see money!

00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:53.206
My whole body starts to dance.

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.036
I hear melodious music.

00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:59.943
Flowers blossom in my eyes.

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:01.765
I can do anything for money.

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:04.397
I can live, I can die.
I can sing. I can dance.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.966
Can you take a bath?
- What?

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.288
Can you take a bath?
The priest is about to come.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.230
The priest.. The priest
is about to get some good news.

00:06:11.313 --> 00:06:13.980
The priest is about
to get some good news.

00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:18.688
Hail Lakshmi (Goddess of wealth).

00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:21.230
Hail Lakshmi.

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:26.158
Mother Lakshmi, your love for the owl,
your ride, very much..

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:28.980
I am your greatest devotee.

00:06:29.216 --> 00:06:33.369
Please take care of your devotee.
Always stay with me.

00:06:33.628 --> 00:06:35.561
Have a great time.

00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:38.680
Oh Mother, never leave me!

00:06:38.842 --> 00:06:40.611
Oh no. It has burnt too much.

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:46.226
Master, you've been burning
the same incense stick for five years.

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:47.892
Why don't you buy some new sticks?

00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:50.859
No matter I use is for
five years or 50 years..

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:54.608
Why do you have a problem
when Mother Lakshmi doesn't have any?

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:57.379
Has the priest arrived?

00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.411
He is waiting for you.

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:03.480
I have brought
photographs of many girls.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.713
Keep them aside.
I don't care about their appearances.

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:07.941
If she is blind,
I will get her an eye.

00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:09.741
If she doesn't have a leg,
I'll get one Jaipur foot for her.

00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:11.287
If she's fat,
I'll stop giving her food.

00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:13.552
Any girl would do, provided that..

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:18.555
..she is the only daughter
of a millionaire father. Sit down.

00:07:18.635 --> 00:07:22.098
But at least their
horoscopes should match.

00:07:22.178 --> 00:07:25.919
That's also not necessary,
but I should get the dowry.

00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:29.116
I have only one son.
I will get him married only once.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.666
So I want to get
a good deal out of him.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.071
Hazari Prasad will do
this deal with utmost care.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.155
Priest, here is tea for you.
- Thank you.

00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:41.917
You fool.
Do you want to kill the priest?

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:43.690
It's just tea, not poison.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.712
You fool, tea contains sugar.

00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:48.214
Sugar causes diabetes.
What if the priest dies due to diabetes?

00:07:48.294 --> 00:07:51.832
I don't have any sugar problem.
- You may catch it.

00:07:51.912 --> 00:07:54.439
Why risk your life
for just a cup of tea?

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:56.824
But I am ready to take the risk.
- But I won't let you drink.

00:07:56.904 --> 00:07:58.613
I will drink.
- I won't let you drink. - I will drink.

00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:00.073
There's a fly in the tea.

00:08:05.905 --> 00:08:08.863
See. Neither you got it,
nor did I get it.

00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:10.405
The fly got it.

00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:16.863
Hazari Prasad will not
waste this tea.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.530
Oh God!

00:08:24.655 --> 00:08:26.863
So what were you saying?

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:31.821
I got your point,
but your son should also like the girl.

00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:34.321
You don't worry about my son.

00:08:35.071 --> 00:08:40.740
He is my blood.
The uniqueness of our family is..

00:08:41.196 --> 00:08:44.012
..we can lose anything,
but not money.

00:09:26.655 --> 00:09:28.655
Why are you misbehaving
with a helpless girl?

00:09:28.738 --> 00:09:30.405
I wasn't misbehaving.

00:09:31.477 --> 00:09:35.215
Well, she looks like my sister..

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:38.670
..who passed away when she was born.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.841
So sad.

00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:42.728
If you don't mind.

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:46.613
Please tie this rakhi
(bond of sisterly love) to me.

00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:49.238
Why not?! Sure.
- Thanks.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.937
Okay, Sister. Be in touch.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.308
He is here.

00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:05.905
You could have been
in huge trouble or else..

00:10:05.988 --> 00:10:08.426
Or else what? I have one policy.

00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:10.828
If she doesn't agree
there is always a rakhi ready.

00:10:12.185 --> 00:10:14.882
Let's go.
We're getting late for college.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.613
Oh yes.
- Come on, let's go.

00:10:19.905 --> 00:10:23.238
Raja! Is this the
time to come to college?

00:10:23.988 --> 00:10:26.446
Answer me! Why are you silent?

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:35.238
My father had a heart
attack for the fourth time.

00:10:35.446 --> 00:10:38.383
Oh my God!
You should have been in the hospital.

00:10:38.577 --> 00:10:40.488
But sir, what about the lectures,
my attendance..

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:43.071
I will take care of all that.
Now go. Hurry up!

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.451
Thank you, sir.

00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:45.783
It's okay.

00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:47.445
Thank you so much.
- Go.

00:10:49.113 --> 00:10:51.863
Bye.
- What are you looking at?

00:10:51.946 --> 00:10:54.071
Go to your classes!
- Sorry, sir. - Go!

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.530
So as I told you, in Ohm's law..

00:10:57.863 --> 00:10:59.946
..the current flowing in a circuit..

00:11:00.113 --> 00:11:04.526
..is directly proportional to
the voltage and inversely proportional..

00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:15.363
Where are you going?
The lecture is not over.

00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:27.155
Be silent. Silence.

00:11:27.756 --> 00:11:31.291
Friends, a storm had come
into this world 21 years ago.

00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.155
Tonight, again a storm is
about to come.

00:11:34.238 --> 00:11:38.783
Tonight, you'll be flooded with beer.

00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:41.321
The world will shake
with the dancing.

00:11:41.446 --> 00:11:46.323
Because today it's Raja's
birthday and you all are invited.

00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:07.405
Your bill for 200 chickens.

00:12:09.363 --> 00:12:11.180
Raja sees the heart,
but never sees the bill.

00:12:11.616 --> 00:12:13.155
The bill will be paid by my daddy.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.896
"Father says I will make him proud."

00:12:21.265 --> 00:12:25.349
"My son will do something great."

00:12:25.429 --> 00:12:35.155
"But no one knows
where my destination is."

00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:40.444
"I love to love you, baby."

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.015
"I love to love you, baby."

00:12:45.617 --> 00:12:47.625
"Do it to me again and again."

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.155
"Hey, come to me."

00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:56.220
"I love to love you, baby."

00:12:56.885 --> 00:13:00.280
"I love to love you, baby."
- Move aside.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.988
Pandu, what's going on?

00:13:02.068 --> 00:13:04.113
Can't you see?!
The party is going on.

00:13:04.196 --> 00:13:06.501
Okay, but where are
you taking these dry fruits?

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:10.613
It's for the guest.
- Give it to me.

00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:13.488
You shouldn't eat it.
- Why?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.446
Because you may not
be able to digest it.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.196
Whom did you call a dog?

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:00.162
Silly.

00:14:00.867 --> 00:14:02.116
Who's that?

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.933
Hey, you. Look at this bill.

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:33.946
What did you do last night?

00:15:34.946 --> 00:15:36.363
Will your dad pay these bills?

00:15:36.443 --> 00:15:37.282
Of course, Dad.

00:15:37.362 --> 00:15:39.783
You need not ask me.
You pay the bills.

00:15:39.863 --> 00:15:41.836
How dare you talk to me like this?

00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:45.155
Why are you scolding him?

00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:49.738
He ruined me.
He spent Rs.20,000 in one night.

00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:52.024
You are wrong,
it was not 20,000, but it was 19,800.

00:15:52.308 --> 00:15:54.863
He doesn't throw parties regularly.

00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:56.530
Yesterday was his birthday.

00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:59.696
It was his birthday,
but it was doomsday for me.

00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:03.655
Ever since he was born,
he has celebrated his birthday 21 times.

00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:08.363
I earn money with so much hard work..

00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:11.655
..but you spend it so easily.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.321
You merciless person.

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:17.155
You had too much money in your vault.

00:16:17.446 --> 00:16:20.113
I spent just a little. Move aside.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.030
Are you searching for something?
- Keys for my bike.

00:16:23.113 --> 00:16:25.030
Hello, they are gone.

00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:27.121
Where have they gone?

00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:28.863
With the motorcycle.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:31.488
Where is my motorcycle?
- I sold it.

00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:34.849
You sold it! Why?
- To pay the bills.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.280
How will I go to college?

00:16:37.655 --> 00:16:40.363
Just like Mahatma Gandhi went
to Dhandi from Sabarmati. On foot!

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:42.613
What have you done?
- Nothing.

00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:45.030
I have shown him what
the whole world knows.

00:16:45.113 --> 00:16:47.851
What?
- That I am your father.

00:16:52.488 --> 00:16:54.708
We had a lot of fun
at your party last night.

00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:58.071
Your father is a great person.
- Don't talk about my father.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.706
Are you blind?

00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:19.945
Has your father brought
this road along with the car?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.071
Hey, mister!
Why don't you look before you walk?

00:17:24.445 --> 00:17:28.026
Don't you know how
to walk on the road? Fool!

00:17:28.316 --> 00:17:29.110
Idiot.

00:17:36.247 --> 00:17:39.524
She's just too much!

00:17:39.762 --> 00:17:41.876
She looks like a newcomer.

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:44.321
She's as proud as she is beautiful.

00:17:44.499 --> 00:17:49.238
She's just too hot!

00:17:50.516 --> 00:17:55.534
Tomorrow I'll teach her a lesson.

00:18:07.363 --> 00:18:09.341
Can't you see where you are walking?
Are you blind?

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.738
Can somebody help me?

00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:15.466
Oh my God, he's really blind.

00:18:16.363 --> 00:18:17.783
My books.

00:18:18.613 --> 00:18:19.792
My stick!

00:18:22.566 --> 00:18:23.441
Listen.

00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:25.030
Here is your stick.
- Who?

00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:27.321
Did you get hurt?

00:18:28.655 --> 00:18:31.863
The Lord has already
disabled me for life.

00:18:32.155 --> 00:18:34.071
These things don't hurt me anymore.

00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:36.030
It's not your fault.

00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:40.196
It's a big mistake to be born blind.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.613
Don't say that.

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:45.488
Shall I drop you somewhere?

00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:47.863
It doesn't matter to a blind man..

00:18:48.238 --> 00:18:50.238
..whether he is coming
or going somewhere.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.863
God has already taken my eyes.

00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:56.863
I was going to college
to enlighten my mind.

00:18:57.439 --> 00:19:02.821
For your information, I study in
the blind section of G.K. College.

00:19:03.196 --> 00:19:06.488
G.K. College! I also study there.
- Really.

00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:07.946
Come on, I'll drop you there.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.071
No. I don't want
to give you any trouble.

00:19:10.155 --> 00:19:13.816
Please come with me.
- Okay.

00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:19.413
Be careful.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.030
On which floor is your class?
- Class!

00:19:25.238 --> 00:19:26.280
Be careful!

00:19:27.155 --> 00:19:28.696
I am sorry.
- It's okay.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.946
Keep your hand on my shoulder.
- Okay.

00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:36.216
Really, you are taking
a lot of trouble for me. - No.

00:19:37.446 --> 00:19:39.425
Today you have helped a blind person.

00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:41.888
You are a very nice girl. Ouch!

00:19:43.363 --> 00:19:45.863
Life has been unjust to you.

00:19:46.363 --> 00:19:48.030
Sometimes God..

00:20:03.028 --> 00:20:04.128
Who are you?

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.196
Dev Anand is my name.

00:20:09.347 --> 00:20:10.247
Shut up!

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:15.533
'For those who hate me,
I will fill their hearts with love.'

00:20:15.613 --> 00:20:18.626
'I am the person
who can soften a rock.'

00:20:19.057 --> 00:20:20.007
Get lost!

00:20:24.426 --> 00:20:25.895
You fool.

00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:32.821
'The way she collided against me.'

00:20:33.321 --> 00:20:36.506
'I swear I enjoyed it.'

00:20:43.173 --> 00:20:44.557
Who the hell are you?

00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:51.031
I'm the one on whom you had
splashed muddy water yesterday.

00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:53.660
Yesterday I had just
spoilt your face.

00:20:53.863 --> 00:20:57.196
But today,
I will redden your face with my sandal.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.649
"Arrogant is her stance."

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.313
"She's a girl or a cane?"

00:21:35.397 --> 00:21:37.855
"She is fire. She is a banger."

00:21:37.976 --> 00:21:40.180
"She's a cracker of a girl."

00:21:40.261 --> 00:21:42.386
"Anger in her eyes."

00:21:42.813 --> 00:21:44.730
"Always ready with abuses."

00:21:45.914 --> 00:21:50.206
"Look at what she thinks of herself!"

00:21:51.063 --> 00:21:53.524
"Arrogant is her stance."

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.105
"She's a girl or a cane?"

00:21:56.355 --> 00:21:58.813
"She is fire. She is a banger."

00:21:58.938 --> 00:22:01.022
"She's a cracker of a girl."

00:22:01.147 --> 00:22:02.938
"Anger in her eyes."

00:22:03.748 --> 00:22:05.831
"Always ready with abuses."

00:22:06.813 --> 00:22:11.688
"Look at what she thinks of herself!"

00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:55.313
"Fairly skinned,
but electrifying to handle."

00:22:56.147 --> 00:22:58.563
"She is too short-tempered."

00:22:58.688 --> 00:23:00.897
"Get closer and you'll burn."

00:23:13.688 --> 00:23:18.230
"Fairly skinned,
but electrifying to handle."

00:23:18.813 --> 00:23:21.105
"She is too short-tempered."

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.480
"Get closer and you'll burn."

00:23:23.938 --> 00:23:29.022
"Don't mess with her.
Don't put your life into trouble."

00:23:29.147 --> 00:23:34.105
"Don't mess with her.
Don't put your life into trouble."

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.438
"No!"

00:23:35.563 --> 00:23:37.022
"No!"

00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:38.855
"No! No! No! No!"

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.188
"Arrogant is her stance. "

00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:44.522
"She's a girl or a cane?"

00:23:44.813 --> 00:23:47.230
"She is fire. She is a banger."

00:23:47.438 --> 00:23:49.480
"She's a cracker of a girl."

00:23:49.605 --> 00:23:51.480
"Anger in her eyes."

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.537
"Always ready with abuses."

00:23:55.247 --> 00:23:59.580
"Look at what she thinks of herself!"

00:24:31.563 --> 00:24:36.230
"Comes to college to study."

00:24:36.726 --> 00:24:41.434
"But is always ready for a fight."

00:24:47.147 --> 00:24:51.813
"Comes to college to study."

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.772
"But is always ready for a fight."

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:02.688
"We have taken the vow.
We will smash her pride."

00:25:02.772 --> 00:25:07.605
"We have taken the vow.
We will smash her pride."

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.980
"Yes!"

00:25:09.063 --> 00:25:10.369
"Yes!"

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.866
"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!"

00:25:14.008 --> 00:25:16.488
"Arrogant is her stance."

00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:19.069
"She's a girl or a cane?"

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.749
"She is fire. She is a banger."

00:25:21.842 --> 00:25:23.842
"She's a cracker of a girl."

00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:25.681
"Anger in her eyes."

00:25:26.428 --> 00:25:28.844
"Always ready with abuses."

00:25:29.605 --> 00:25:33.855
"Look at what she thinks of herself!"

00:25:34.782 --> 00:25:39.657
"Look at what she thinks of herself!"

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.650
Place some more.
Don't behave like a miser.

00:26:07.882 --> 00:26:09.565
Place some more.
- I am.

00:26:09.646 --> 00:26:11.326
More. More.

00:26:11.484 --> 00:26:13.155
Please it on the weights.
Why are you sitting on the scale?

00:26:13.236 --> 00:26:16.028
Are you weighing gold?

00:26:16.294 --> 00:26:18.435
I weigh 32kg.
Why do we need the weights?

00:26:18.522 --> 00:26:21.415
You are 32kg?
You're not less than 72kg.

00:26:21.495 --> 00:26:24.703
Who weighs 72kg by eating
just two loaves of bread a day?!

00:26:24.787 --> 00:26:26.287
You are just cheating!

00:26:26.436 --> 00:26:29.279
If you want to do business
with Hazari Prasad..

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.610
..then you have to do it his way.

00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:35.831
What are you doing here?
Lakshmi is at your doorstep.

00:26:35.912 --> 00:26:37.037
Where is Lakshmi?

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.120
This is Mr. Girdharilal,
whom I had told you about earlier.

00:26:40.203 --> 00:26:45.370
Mr. Girdharilal, please come in.
Have a seat.

00:26:45.953 --> 00:26:47.162
What can I do for you?

00:26:47.245 --> 00:26:51.037
He saw your son on the college stage.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.826
He likes your son.
- Wonderful!

00:26:53.937 --> 00:26:56.130
Murari, bring two cups of tea.
No. No.

00:26:56.221 --> 00:26:57.554
I got it, sir.

00:26:58.208 --> 00:27:02.190
I like your daughter.
- What are you expectations?

00:27:02.271 --> 00:27:03.816
Can you give me
an approximate number?

00:27:03.897 --> 00:27:07.855
Approximate number?
I have the complete list ready.

00:27:07.937 --> 00:27:09.812
Have a look. It is a small list.

00:27:24.808 --> 00:27:27.975
Mr. Hazari Prasad,
I am not a very rich person.

00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:31.229
Can you reduce some of your demands?

00:27:31.687 --> 00:27:34.437
If you want a discount,
go to some other shop for your daughter.

00:27:34.518 --> 00:27:38.852
Priest.
- I will, but let me tell you something.

00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:42.396
You buy and sell junk.
You are a junk-shop owner.

00:27:42.812 --> 00:27:44.437
Going by your demands..

00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:48.937
..you would have to marry off
your son to a millionaire's daughter.

00:27:50.481 --> 00:27:53.314
The whole world will
see and so will you.

00:27:53.437 --> 00:27:57.869
I will get my son married
to a millionaire's daughter.

00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:02.646
You've made me walk quite a lot.

00:28:02.727 --> 00:28:07.268
How much more do I have to walk?
- Just a little bit more.

00:28:07.349 --> 00:28:10.016
I'll die, if I walk even
one more step.

00:28:10.097 --> 00:28:12.931
Why do you want to kill me?

00:28:13.032 --> 00:28:14.699
Couldn't we take the bus?

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.947
Why take a bus? We are almost there.

00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:20.316
We've already walked 10km,
just three more to go.

00:28:20.397 --> 00:28:22.986
Three km more? No, I won't walk.

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:26.306
What are you doing? Get up. Go away.

00:28:26.437 --> 00:28:29.021
Why are you pushing us?
- The hotel's owner is coming.

00:28:35.354 --> 00:28:36.729
Good morning, sir.

00:28:37.937 --> 00:28:39.271
What were you saying, Varma?

00:28:39.354 --> 00:28:41.775
We've made profits of
50 lakhs from our Delhi hotel.

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:45.647
50 lakhs! Don't waste my time.
50 lakhs is nothing.

00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:48.324
It's peanuts.
Do you know what a peanut is? - Peanuts.

00:28:51.746 --> 00:28:54.705
50 lakhs! Peanuts! Peanuts!

00:28:55.354 --> 00:28:58.937
We've made Rs.2 crore profit
from our London hotel, La Marina.

00:28:59.018 --> 00:29:01.313
Just two crores!
We were expecting four crores.

00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:03.703
This isn't profit. This is a loss.
- Sorry, sir.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.183
Today, you have an important meeting.
- With whom?

00:29:10.311 --> 00:29:12.836
About the proposal of
Mehra Group of hotels, Dubai.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.023
It's impossible today.

00:29:14.104 --> 00:29:16.475
Today is the 17th birthday
of my daughter, Madhu.

00:29:16.856 --> 00:29:19.564
We will lose lakhs of rupees.

00:29:19.812 --> 00:29:22.485
No. My daughter's birthday
comes once in a year.

00:29:22.729 --> 00:29:25.753
I can lose lakhs,
but I can't break her heart.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.262
A millionaire! With an only daughter!

00:29:30.343 --> 00:29:33.696
A millionaire! With an only daughter!
- Where are you?

00:29:33.813 --> 00:29:36.647
The bride's father is
waiting for you.

00:29:36.854 --> 00:29:37.699
Let's go.

00:29:39.521 --> 00:29:40.948
I've found the bride's father.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:45.779
What? - I'm the luckiest
person in this world!

00:29:46.104 --> 00:29:48.479
This millionaire?
- Yes!

00:29:49.173 --> 00:29:53.131
Even his cook's daughter
won't marry your son.

00:29:53.263 --> 00:29:55.388
He'll throw you out of his house.

00:29:55.469 --> 00:29:57.681
Or he will send you
to some mental asylum.

00:29:57.802 --> 00:29:59.927
Forget about this
alliance and come with me.

00:30:00.062 --> 00:30:01.619
The bride's father
will be waiting for you.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.367
Let me be.
You don't know about Hazari Prasad.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.802
I've found the millionaire
I was looking for.

00:30:09.115 --> 00:30:12.115
I will do anything..

00:30:12.437 --> 00:30:16.957
..to have my son marry
this millionaire's daughter.

00:30:32.556 --> 00:30:34.348
May God bless you.

00:30:39.326 --> 00:30:41.451
God bless you.

00:30:43.271 --> 00:30:45.854
Very good, Varma. Govind?
- I have taken the appointment.

00:30:45.937 --> 00:30:48.513
Shall we invite the quotations
of Bennet and Miranda?

00:30:48.594 --> 00:30:49.867
What's there to think about it?

00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:51.801
Tell them that..

00:30:57.696 --> 00:30:59.821
..Hazari Mills have made
lakhs of profit. - Next.

00:30:59.953 --> 00:31:02.120
There's an inauguration ceremony
of Hazari Chemicals today. - Next.

00:31:02.229 --> 00:31:04.822
There is also a meeting of
Hazari Shipping Corporation today.

00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:08.545
He looks like a very big personality.

00:31:09.114 --> 00:31:12.781
He must belong to a rich family,
like me.

00:31:16.979 --> 00:31:19.062
How much do I owe you?
- Rs.500.

00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:22.774
Rs.500! Are you crazy?
Rs.500 for four dogs?

00:31:22.854 --> 00:31:25.604
I could have hired 50 men instead.

00:31:25.687 --> 00:31:28.604
These days,
dogs are more important than men.

00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:29.684
Take this.

00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:33.062
Sir? -The dogs were small.
You cheat, take it.

00:31:33.146 --> 00:31:33.987
Sir..

00:31:34.604 --> 00:31:35.854
What role did you play?
- Secretary.

00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:37.816
What?
- Pay me quickly.

00:31:37.897 --> 00:31:40.063
I've got to go for the shooting.
Mr. Bachchan is waiting for me.

00:31:40.146 --> 00:31:42.687
How much do I owe you?
- Rs.400.

00:31:42.979 --> 00:31:45.354
It's stopped!
My heart has stopped beating.

00:31:45.593 --> 00:31:46.617
Rs.400.

00:31:52.271 --> 00:31:56.021
You'd rather have pet
dogs or be an actor, than rob.

00:31:57.189 --> 00:32:02.189
"No one's face is
as beautiful as you."

00:32:02.312 --> 00:32:05.229
Have you joined some theatre group?

00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:08.315
The dogs, the actors!
What's all this?

00:32:08.396 --> 00:32:10.562
This is business.
- Business!

00:32:10.643 --> 00:32:14.518
You won't understand. In this
business you make crores in profit..

00:32:14.615 --> 00:32:18.404
..by investing just lakhs of rupees.

00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:22.434
You are really great.
You are really gutsy.

00:32:22.515 --> 00:32:25.307
What have I done?
- Don't act so innocently.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.683
You have openly challenged
Karate Champion, Shakti..

00:32:28.764 --> 00:32:30.687
..and now you are asking
me what have I done?

00:32:30.771 --> 00:32:33.271
I have challenged Shakti?
- Yes, of course.

00:32:33.352 --> 00:32:34.772
That's what the whole
college is talking about.

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:39.029
Raja will break Shakti's bones.
Raja's challenge.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.629
Shakti will walk in,
but he will go back on a stretcher.

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:46.102
Raja's challenge.
- You are really gutsy.

00:32:46.271 --> 00:32:49.229
Raja will die in style.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.685
What rubbish. I've got
nothing to do with these posters.

00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:54.062
What?
- Yes.

00:32:54.146 --> 00:32:56.067
Then whose mischief is this?

00:32:58.854 --> 00:33:02.021
Cowards run away
when they are losing.

00:33:02.251 --> 00:33:05.251
But some cowards are too arrogant.

00:33:06.315 --> 00:33:08.190
He will die a young death.

00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:11.835
I shouldn't be saying this,
but Raja is finished!

00:33:14.407 --> 00:33:18.896
I won't let it happen.
I will remove these posters right now.

00:33:19.021 --> 00:33:22.854
Buddy, if you remove the
posters I will be disgraced.

00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:24.739
Let's see what happens.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.987
I hope it's not your funeral.

00:33:27.104 --> 00:33:30.045
Shakti. Shakti. Shakti. Shakti.

00:33:30.126 --> 00:33:33.365
Shakti. Shakti. Shakti. Shakti.

00:33:33.446 --> 00:33:36.655
Raja hasn't shown up.
I guess he won't come.

00:33:36.946 --> 00:33:38.222
Maybe he has given up.

00:33:38.303 --> 00:33:41.553
Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja!

00:33:41.946 --> 00:33:44.876
Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja!

00:33:45.027 --> 00:33:47.277
Raja! Raja! Ra..

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.470
Raja! Raja! Raja!

00:34:07.913 --> 00:34:11.256
Shakti. Shakti. Shakti. Shakti.

00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:17.486
Friends, we have with us three-time
college champion, Mr. Shakti.

00:34:18.646 --> 00:34:20.077
Give him a big hand.

00:34:23.237 --> 00:34:24.894
Quiet!

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.155
He is Mr. Raja.

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:38.946
He has shown great courage
by challenging Shakti, but..

00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:44.988
..we'd be doing injustice to
Raja if we don't give him a last chance.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.323
To save himself from
being humiliated..

00:34:47.577 --> 00:34:50.182
..Raja can still refuse to fight.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.863
This is your chance to refuse.

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:54.608
But there is a condition.

00:34:55.114 --> 00:34:59.240
He would apologise to Shakti..

00:34:59.446 --> 00:35:02.780
..by touching his feet
in front of everyone.

00:35:09.655 --> 00:35:14.280
I am ready to fight,
but I too have a condition.

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:18.696
If Miss. Madhu has the guts
then she should accept my condition.

00:35:19.771 --> 00:35:21.071
What's the condition?

00:35:22.128 --> 00:35:26.280
The condition is that if I win..

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:33.488
..I will kiss Madhu
in front of everyone.

00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:42.196
Okay. I accept it..

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.293
..but I too have a condition.

00:35:44.789 --> 00:35:50.338
If Mr. Raja loses,
he will kiss my friend, Miss Mimi.

00:35:50.863 --> 00:35:52.696
Miss. Mimi.

00:36:05.957 --> 00:36:07.123
I accept it.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.780
But if Mr. Shakti loses,
he will kiss Miss Mimi.

00:36:19.797 --> 00:36:22.588
Ready. Fight.

00:36:41.755 --> 00:36:43.130
Come on.

00:36:51.815 --> 00:36:53.190
Come on, Shakti.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.116
Beat him!

00:37:15.198 --> 00:37:16.083
Hey!

00:37:18.532 --> 00:37:21.122
Shakti. Shakti. Shakti. Shakti.

00:37:21.318 --> 00:37:22.657
Here Raja.

00:37:22.854 --> 00:37:26.988
Shakti. Shakti. Shakti. Shakti.

00:37:48.847 --> 00:37:49.921
Beat him, Raja!

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.815
Get him!

00:37:57.766 --> 00:38:01.391
1-2-3-4.

00:38:01.472 --> 00:38:04.889
5-6-7.

00:38:34.808 --> 00:38:36.171
Shakti, get up.

00:38:41.808 --> 00:38:42.870
Come on, Shakti.

00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:58.558
1-2.
- Shakti, get up.

00:38:58.915 --> 00:39:03.560
3-4-5-6..

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.891
Come on, Shakti, get up.

00:39:05.022 --> 00:39:08.147
8-9 and 10.
- Get up!

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.933
Oh, no.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.808
Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja!

00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:17.170
Silence.

00:39:19.058 --> 00:39:22.391
Friends, as per the conditions..

00:39:22.808 --> 00:39:28.058
..our new Champion
Raja will kiss Miss Madhu..

00:39:28.316 --> 00:39:32.016
..in front of everyone.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.770
Miss. Madhu, please come. Welcome.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.818
Friends, give her a big hand.

00:40:49.141 --> 00:40:51.475
When I was younger I was taught..

00:40:52.096 --> 00:40:55.013
..to always stay away
from unimportant people.

00:40:59.225 --> 00:41:03.641
Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja!

00:41:03.766 --> 00:41:11.817
Raja! Raja! Raja! Raja!

00:41:18.808 --> 00:41:20.850
No.

00:41:28.933 --> 00:41:32.183
Son, are you going to the temple?
- Yes, Mother.

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:35.308
Have you thought about Madhu?

00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:37.475
That's why I am going to the temple.

00:41:37.725 --> 00:41:40.141
I am going to request
God to do something about her..

00:41:40.225 --> 00:41:41.266
..and I'll also try to do my bit.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.058
But where is Madhu?

00:41:44.516 --> 00:41:47.683
There you are.
- Daddy, I want a goli (bullet).

00:41:47.766 --> 00:41:50.933
Didn't Ramu give you
the vitamin goli?

00:41:51.016 --> 00:41:54.516
I need a bullet.
- Bullet!

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.728
What happened?

00:41:55.808 --> 00:41:57.808
I will kill that scum.

00:41:58.141 --> 00:42:01.725
Until I shoot him,
I won't have my breakfast.

00:42:01.959 --> 00:42:02.959
What happened?

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.516
He insulted me in front of everyone.

00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:08.225
Insulted you?! How?

00:42:08.433 --> 00:42:09.891
He held me in front of everyone..

00:42:10.016 --> 00:42:11.808
What did he do to you?

00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:14.183
He did nothing.

00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:17.701
He did nothing?
Then how were you insulted?

00:42:18.016 --> 00:42:20.350
Let her speak.
- Good morning, Uncle.

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:22.560
Hello.
- Greetings, grandma.

00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:23.808
Greetings!
- Hi!

00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:25.475
What happened to you?

00:42:26.058 --> 00:42:28.350
Are you alright?
- I am absolutely fine.

00:42:28.475 --> 00:42:30.794
But your lips look swollen.
- What?

00:42:31.145 --> 00:42:34.350
No, sir. The thing is..

00:42:35.641 --> 00:42:38.350
..I'm boxing a bit too much.

00:42:38.475 --> 00:42:41.141
Don't box so much..

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:42.933
..or else it will
be hard to recognise you.

00:42:43.141 --> 00:42:44.475
When is your father
coming back from London?

00:42:44.641 --> 00:42:46.165
Next week.
- Next week! - Yes.

00:42:46.246 --> 00:42:47.894
I forgot. I had to go to the temple.

00:42:47.975 --> 00:42:50.058
You keep talking. I am leaving.
- Ok.

00:42:58.691 --> 00:42:59.732
Take it.

00:43:00.386 --> 00:43:02.753
Hail to you.
- Hail to you.

00:43:03.346 --> 00:43:04.593
God bless you.
- Be happy.

00:43:04.674 --> 00:43:08.350
Our saviour is here.
Our Almighty is here. - He is here.

00:43:08.516 --> 00:43:09.850
Our God is here.

00:43:09.975 --> 00:43:14.728
Our God is here.
Long live our master.

00:43:14.808 --> 00:43:16.600
Get up.

00:43:17.516 --> 00:43:19.975
Greetings.
- Who is he?

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.808
He looks like a reincarnation of God.

00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:24.433
Please sit, everyone will get it.
- Sit down. Don't rush.

00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:26.891
Take this.
- Sit quietly.

00:43:27.016 --> 00:43:29.016
He'll give you, sit quietly.
- You take it as well.

00:43:29.865 --> 00:43:30.683
Take this.

00:43:33.058 --> 00:43:35.891
What would've happened to
us if you had not been there for us?

00:43:36.058 --> 00:43:39.683
I think that I am poorer than you.

00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:41.435
God has given me so much money..

00:43:41.516 --> 00:43:43.641
..but he has given
me just two hands to give.

00:43:43.725 --> 00:43:47.376
I wish he'd have given
me 1,000 hands to donate.

00:43:49.266 --> 00:43:51.183
God bless you!

00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:04.149
Mother Goddess,
you have given me so much wealth.

00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:08.183
But still,
I come to you everyday as a beggar.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.058
I beg to you.

00:44:10.433 --> 00:44:12.350
The way you have given
me so much wealth..

00:44:12.863 --> 00:44:14.947
..give me a good daughter-in-law.

00:44:15.225 --> 00:44:17.558
I don't want anything else.

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:21.238
I just want a good daughter-in-law.

00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:24.641
Mother. Give me
a good daughter-in-law.

00:44:24.933 --> 00:44:28.850
Give me a good daughter-in-law.

00:44:36.933 --> 00:44:38.118
Yes, sir.

00:44:38.811 --> 00:44:40.227
Go.
- Yes, sir.

00:44:41.433 --> 00:44:42.343
Mother.

00:44:53.808 --> 00:44:56.641
The tyres have been punctured.
- Don't you have any spare tyres?

00:44:56.874 --> 00:44:58.963
We have only one spare tyre,
but two tyres are punctured.

00:44:59.058 --> 00:45:02.100
I had such an important meeting
and there is no phone around..

00:45:02.183 --> 00:45:04.322
If you don't mind,
I can give you a lift.

00:45:04.403 --> 00:45:07.278
I will drop you wherever you want.
- Don't trouble yourself.

00:45:07.683 --> 00:45:10.433
Take this. Give us a sandwich.

00:45:10.753 --> 00:45:12.795
A Rs.100 note.
How did you get a Rs.100 note?

00:45:12.891 --> 00:45:15.410
Why do you care?
- Okay.

00:45:17.225 --> 00:45:19.891
This is a fake currency note.

00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:24.058
Take it away.
I'll take you to the police. Go away.

00:45:24.141 --> 00:45:26.766
A fake note? Ramu.
- Mine is also a fake note.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.475
Your? - Mine, too.
- Where is that man?

00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:32.350
There's no problem at all.
Please come. - There he is.

00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:34.098
It's very sweet of you.
Thank you very much. God bless you.

00:45:34.225 --> 00:45:35.391
Catch him!

00:45:37.641 --> 00:45:39.975
You gave us fake notes.
You fooled us.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.308
Goodbye.

00:45:43.016 --> 00:45:45.475
They love you a lot.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.350
They respect you more than God.

00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:50.225
It's just their affection.

00:45:50.683 --> 00:45:53.725
No one can become a God
by donating some 10 to 20 lakhs.

00:45:53.847 --> 00:45:55.308
Drive faster.

00:45:55.391 --> 00:45:58.850
Beat him!
Catch him! Don't let him escape!

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:03.433
He made a fool of us.
He gave us fake notes.

00:46:03.516 --> 00:46:07.683
If I get him, I will break his teeth.
- Beat him!

00:46:07.766 --> 00:46:09.558
By the way, I am Mehra.
- I am also..

00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:12.308
I mean, I am Hazari Prasad.

00:46:12.933 --> 00:46:15.808
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new in this city?

00:46:15.933 --> 00:46:21.225
No. I belong to this place,
but I left this place to earn money.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.100
By the way,
which business are you in?

00:46:24.308 --> 00:46:26.891
Nothing really.
I have some textile mills..

00:46:26.975 --> 00:46:29.400
..some shipping corporations,
some chemical industries.

00:46:29.481 --> 00:46:32.693
That's it. I'm a small businessman.
- Small businessman!

00:46:32.808 --> 00:46:34.683
You have a very good sense of humour.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:37.770
What are you doing this evening?
- Nothing really. Whatever you say.

00:46:37.901 --> 00:46:39.567
Let's have drinks together.

00:46:39.914 --> 00:46:42.655
Let's meet and have a drink.

00:46:57.936 --> 00:47:00.020
Cheers! Long live our friendship.

00:47:00.228 --> 00:47:01.978
In the name of friendship.

00:47:06.431 --> 00:47:08.482
Where is Mr. Mehra?

00:47:08.706 --> 00:47:10.373
He is very punctual.

00:47:11.103 --> 00:47:13.827
He comes at 9 everyday.
I don't know why he is late today.

00:47:14.103 --> 00:47:15.715
Mr. Mehra has arrived.

00:47:15.796 --> 00:47:17.379
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

00:47:17.978 --> 00:47:19.561
Do you remember all
your dialogues? - Yes.

00:47:19.645 --> 00:47:20.936
Then let's get started.
- Yes.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.436
What do you think of yourself?

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.770
Do you think I'm an immoral,
greedy, and unethical person? Go away.

00:47:27.853 --> 00:47:29.978
What's the matter, Hazari Prasad?
You seem to be very upset.

00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:31.653
What can I say?

00:47:31.734 --> 00:47:35.443
I told this priest so many times that
I just want a good daughter-in-law..

00:47:35.524 --> 00:47:38.316
..even if she is poor.

00:47:38.728 --> 00:47:40.478
But this priest comes along with..

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:42.768
..the proposals of
millionaires and billionaires.

00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:44.686
They want to buy my son.

00:47:44.853 --> 00:47:47.770
Money cannot create
character and virtues.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.270
But this fool doesn't understand.

00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:52.184
Shall I say something?

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.686
Yes, definitely. I'll not feel bad.

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:55.933
This is your right.

00:47:56.936 --> 00:48:00.741
I know a girl who is suitable
to be your daughter-in-law.

00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:02.686
Who is that girl? Where is she?

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.145
I'll be indebted to you forever.

00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:07.270
She is my daughter.

00:48:09.561 --> 00:48:11.103
Your daughter?
- Yes!

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:16.239
Why are you silent? This was
just my opinion. I am not forcing you.

00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:20.885
Our friendship is over.

00:48:23.393 --> 00:48:26.601
Because we are not friends anymore,
but relatives.

00:48:32.331 --> 00:48:34.081
You have such a great
sense of humour.

00:48:34.228 --> 00:48:36.366
Isn't it bizarre that the
girl was right here under my nose..

00:48:36.503 --> 00:48:38.520
..and I was looking
all over the place?

00:48:38.645 --> 00:48:40.686
Match the horoscopes.

00:48:40.767 --> 00:48:43.184
Everything will match after that.
I hope you got it.

00:48:43.311 --> 00:48:46.645
Yes, sir.
Give me your daughter's horoscope.

00:48:46.728 --> 00:48:48.085
I don't have her horoscope.

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:50.103
Then tell me her time,
date and year of birth.

00:48:50.184 --> 00:48:54.439
I remember it very well.
8th January, 1971 in the winter.

00:48:54.543 --> 00:48:56.460
That's okay.
- Write it.

00:49:01.659 --> 00:49:05.772
Jupiter is in the eleventh place.
It matches! Wow!

00:49:05.853 --> 00:49:09.635
Congratulations! Such matching
horoscopes are rare to find.

00:49:09.716 --> 00:49:11.861
All the qualities and
virtues match perfectly.

00:49:12.063 --> 00:49:16.431
Only the horoscopes of Gods
and Goddesses used to match this way.

00:49:16.512 --> 00:49:18.846
Now, Raja and Madhu's
horoscopes have matched.

00:49:18.927 --> 00:49:21.360
It's fantastic!

00:50:43.202 --> 00:50:44.205
Shut up!

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.645
What do you think of yourself?

00:50:53.186 --> 00:50:53.978
Single.

00:50:55.186 --> 00:50:57.061
It's very easy to laugh at others.

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:58.840
If you are a real man,
then dance with me.

00:50:58.921 --> 00:51:01.837
I have told you before,
I don't mess with girls.

00:51:02.805 --> 00:51:05.020
Only a real man can.

00:51:56.317 --> 00:51:58.290
"I won't spare you today."

00:52:00.287 --> 00:52:02.337
"What do you think of me?"

00:52:04.255 --> 00:52:06.209
"I won't spare you today."

00:52:08.173 --> 00:52:10.097
"What do you think of me?"

00:52:12.143 --> 00:52:14.075
"My heart is restless."

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:18.085
"Baby, dance with me."

00:52:19.604 --> 00:52:22.115
"My heart is restless."

00:52:24.029 --> 00:52:26.134
"Baby, dance with me."

00:52:28.127 --> 00:52:30.275
"I won't spare you today."

00:52:32.154 --> 00:52:34.225
"What do you think of me?"

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.119
"My heart is restless."

00:52:40.102 --> 00:52:42.111
"Baby, dance with me."

00:52:44.169 --> 00:52:46.228
"My heart is restless."

00:52:48.103 --> 00:52:50.137
"Baby, dance with me."

00:53:07.457 --> 00:53:11.053
"Don't just move your waist."

00:53:11.625 --> 00:53:15.471
"Match your steps with mine."

00:53:19.587 --> 00:53:23.175
"Don't just move your waist."

00:53:23.606 --> 00:53:27.140
"Match your steps with mine."

00:53:27.647 --> 00:53:29.650
"I will teach you to dance."

00:53:31.658 --> 00:53:33.696
"I will teach you a lesson."

00:53:35.648 --> 00:53:37.846
"My heart is restless."

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.167
"Baby, dance with me."

00:53:43.879 --> 00:53:45.886
"My heart is restless."

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.781
"Baby, dance with me."

00:54:11.919 --> 00:54:15.654
"Don't mess around with me."

00:54:16.077 --> 00:54:19.924
"Run off, you don't have it."

00:54:24.145 --> 00:54:27.663
"Don't mess around with me."

00:54:28.178 --> 00:54:31.601
"Run off, you don't have it."

00:54:32.238 --> 00:54:35.202
"Will destroy you in seconds."

00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:38.430
"I will burn you to ashes."

00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:42.357
"My heart is restless."

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:46.385
"Baby, dance with me."

00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:50.435
"My heart is restless."

00:54:52.433 --> 00:54:54.468
"Baby, dance with me."

00:55:12.595 --> 00:55:16.323
"Go away, don't be so arrogant."

00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:20.622
"Will break your pride."

00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:28.522
"Go away, don't be so arrogant."

00:55:28.837 --> 00:55:32.534
"Will break your pride."

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.851
"Make you fall at my feet."

00:55:36.897 --> 00:55:38.901
"Will make you bow before me."

00:55:40.872 --> 00:55:42.872
"My heart is restless."

00:55:44.843 --> 00:55:46.843
"Baby, dance with me."

00:55:48.714 --> 00:55:51.127
"My heart is restless."

00:55:52.962 --> 00:55:55.049
"Baby, dance with me."

00:56:37.734 --> 00:56:38.657
Greetings, sir.

00:56:38.841 --> 00:56:40.126
Greetings.
- Please, come.

00:56:42.945 --> 00:56:45.403
Please sit.
Mr. Mehra will be here soon. - Okay.

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.396
Where have you brought me?
- Don't mess up.

00:56:48.477 --> 00:56:50.989
I have worked very hard for this.
Don't destroy it.

00:56:51.168 --> 00:56:53.403
How can I marry a girl
whom I have never seen?

00:56:53.486 --> 00:56:55.495
Just the way I did.
- I won't do it.

00:56:55.576 --> 00:56:56.785
I will slap you.
- I will shout.

00:56:56.903 --> 00:56:59.486
Shut up, you fool!
- Hello, Hazari Prasad.

00:56:59.567 --> 00:57:03.109
My son.
- You two seem pretty close.

00:57:03.301 --> 00:57:06.551
I felt like hugging my son. My dear!

00:57:07.778 --> 00:57:09.397
She is my mother.
- Greetings! - Greetings!

00:57:09.478 --> 00:57:11.478
This is my son, Raja.
- God bless you. Sit down.

00:57:11.778 --> 00:57:13.512
Where is your daughter?

00:57:13.593 --> 00:57:15.718
She took Chinky out for a walk.
She will be here in a moment.

00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:19.070
Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, dear. Come.

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.294
He is Mr. Hazari Prasad your
future father-in-law.. - Hello. - Hi!

00:57:22.813 --> 00:57:24.813
That's his son.
- Son.

00:57:26.656 --> 00:57:28.239
You!
- You!

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.861
Do you know each other?

00:57:29.942 --> 00:57:33.421
Do you want me to marry this guy?
This fool!

00:57:33.502 --> 00:57:35.178
I won't even allow Chinky
to get married to him.

00:57:35.259 --> 00:57:38.329
I am ready to marry this dog,
but not you.

00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:40.655
Do you want me to marry this witch?
- Witch!

00:57:40.736 --> 00:57:41.995
Am I a witch?
- Very good.

00:57:42.076 --> 00:57:45.000
Since you two know each
other so well why the delay?

00:57:45.081 --> 00:57:46.780
Congratulations, Mr. Mehra.
- Shut up!

00:57:46.867 --> 00:57:49.867
Don't insult my father.
- What are you doing?

00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:53.986
You don't know him. He's scum.

00:57:54.072 --> 00:57:55.905
Yes and you are a very good girl!

00:57:55.986 --> 00:57:59.570
Why are you spoiling everything?
Keep quiet.

00:57:59.653 --> 00:58:01.570
Move aside, Daddy.
I will deal with this lizard.

00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:04.153
You called me a lizard!

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.425
Daddy, get aside. You cockroach!

00:58:08.111 --> 00:58:09.215
Take this!

00:58:14.716 --> 00:58:17.632
You did this to my father!
I won't spare you.

00:58:18.236 --> 00:58:19.065
Take this.

00:58:23.945 --> 00:58:25.945
A cake for a cake.

00:58:26.026 --> 00:58:29.071
Why are you taking revenge on me?
- You have insulted my father.

00:58:29.153 --> 00:58:30.528
You swine!

00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:32.616
Dear, listen to me.

00:58:32.697 --> 00:58:34.739
Hey, dear. Control her.

00:58:35.016 --> 00:58:35.973
You little rat!

00:58:36.054 --> 00:58:38.614
You can't harm me in any ways.
- Leave me, dad.

00:58:38.695 --> 00:58:40.903
Go away, you witch!
- How dare you?

00:58:40.986 --> 00:58:42.986
I will deal with you.
- I will not spare him.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.156
He called me a lizard.
- Let go off me!

00:58:45.236 --> 00:58:49.070
Let go of me, Daddy. You have
been insulted. I will not stay here.

00:58:49.278 --> 00:58:51.127
I'm leaving.
- Stop, son.

00:58:51.208 --> 00:58:53.833
Hazari, how can this happen to you?
Mr. Mehra.

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.841
I am dead. Save me.

00:59:09.153 --> 00:59:12.695
I will die? I won't stay alive!

00:59:12.861 --> 00:59:15.111
My last days are here.

00:59:15.403 --> 00:59:18.903
My son will be solely
responsible for my death.

00:59:18.986 --> 00:59:23.053
Control yourself or else
your health will deteriorate.

00:59:23.134 --> 00:59:25.028
It can't get worse than this.

00:59:25.356 --> 00:59:27.231
Lift it a bit.

00:59:28.028 --> 00:59:30.403
He has caused me crores of losses.

00:59:30.736 --> 00:59:34.653
That scum has refused the
wealth which was coming his way.

00:59:35.212 --> 00:59:36.337
I will never forgive him.

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:38.822
I am getting angry.
I will not spare him.

00:59:38.903 --> 00:59:41.570
I will bury him alive. Where is he?

00:59:44.299 --> 00:59:45.239
There he is.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:50.575
I won't spare you. Let me go.

00:59:51.232 --> 00:59:55.341
I won't spare you.
I will strangle you. I will kill you.

00:59:55.803 --> 00:59:57.153
What are you doing?

00:59:57.353 --> 00:59:59.528
There's no need to kill me.

00:59:59.736 --> 01:00:01.778
You will be hanged for this.

01:00:01.983 --> 01:00:05.191
I will kill myself to satisfy you.
Get aside.

01:00:08.278 --> 01:00:12.445
Till now only the vegetables
were cut with this knife.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.445
But today I will cut myself.

01:00:18.153 --> 01:00:20.611
Raja, what are you doing?
- Let me die.

01:00:20.692 --> 01:00:21.984
Who are you threatening?
Go on, kill yourself.

01:00:22.111 --> 01:00:24.319
What's going on? Is this
how a father and son should behave?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.655
Are all the sons like him?
- Are all the fathers like him?

01:00:26.736 --> 01:00:28.861
What? - No!
- Get aside.

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.822
You'd have to marry that girl.
- Never!

01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:32.163
I won't marry that witch!

01:00:32.244 --> 01:00:33.693
Even your father will marry her.

01:00:33.774 --> 01:00:35.108
Then go marry her.
- What?

01:00:35.611 --> 01:00:39.195
I'll not spare you.
- Hey.. Let him go. Have you gone mad?

01:00:39.597 --> 01:00:43.681
He is young blood.
What if he does something?

01:00:43.823 --> 01:00:46.198
Come with me, my son. Let's go.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.028
Hazari Prasad is not
going to give up so easily.

01:00:51.385 --> 01:00:54.010
You will surely marry that girl.

01:00:54.195 --> 01:00:56.986
You don't know your father yet.

01:00:57.364 --> 01:01:00.659
Don't get me wrong, Hazari Prasad.

01:01:00.795 --> 01:01:06.212
These days, sons and daughters
seldom listen to their parents.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:08.247
I don't want to force my daughter.

01:01:08.653 --> 01:01:12.611
Call her. I will talk to her.
She may listen to me.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:17.320
Relax. Tomorrow,
my daughter is going to Ooty..

01:01:17.447 --> 01:01:19.322
..with her friends for camping.

01:01:19.403 --> 01:01:22.153
You can meet and talk to her
when she comes back. Have a drink.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.787
"My friend has come from Bombay."

01:01:24.868 --> 01:01:27.287
"Greet my friend."

01:01:27.368 --> 01:01:31.993
"Eat and drink at night,
rest during the day."

01:01:32.236 --> 01:01:35.111
Asha! Do you know something?

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:40.822
A poor guy came to my
house to ask me to marry him.

01:01:40.903 --> 01:01:42.653
Really?! What happened next?

01:01:42.736 --> 01:01:46.028
Even my dog rejected him.

01:01:47.856 --> 01:01:52.469
Later he got beaten up very badly.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.423
That even if he gets
married his kids will be bald.

01:02:07.945 --> 01:02:10.111
Come on, boys and girls.
Let's get down.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.945
Catch this
- Here is your suitcase.

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.650
Leave my bag.
I have to go to the toilet.

01:02:15.262 --> 01:02:16.486
Move!

01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:18.111
Babloo! Do something for me.

01:02:18.195 --> 01:02:20.695
Put a cap on this lens
and shut the camera properly.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:21.850
Yes.
- Okay?

01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:24.982
Divya, hold this and
please carry my luggage.

01:02:25.221 --> 01:02:26.343
I will freshen up.

01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:27.553
Okay.

01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:30.570
Hold this.
I will be back in a moment.

01:02:30.651 --> 01:02:32.984
Rakesh, please, get my bag too.
- Where are you going?

01:02:41.486 --> 01:02:42.397
Here!

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:16.753
Oh no!

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.454
Please.

01:03:30.195 --> 01:03:34.278
The girl was young.
The situation was serious.

01:03:34.361 --> 01:03:37.241
She had to go to Japan,
but she reached China.

01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:54.153
That girl will never
mess with you again.

01:03:54.236 --> 01:03:57.043
Whenever she goes to the
washroom she will remember you.

01:03:59.555 --> 01:04:01.855
Your room is here. No.9.

01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:03.614
Good night.
- No.9. Good night.

01:04:03.695 --> 01:04:04.611
Goodnight, friends.

01:04:04.695 --> 01:04:05.945
Goodnight.
- Let's go to sleep.

01:04:06.028 --> 01:04:08.509
Say goodnight to each other.
- Good night, Vishal.

01:04:30.486 --> 01:04:31.986
Help!

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.070
Help!
- Who are you? Let me go.

01:04:34.153 --> 01:04:35.097
Let me go!

01:04:36.111 --> 01:04:37.403
Help!

01:04:37.945 --> 01:04:39.070
Let me go.

01:04:39.295 --> 01:04:41.432
Come on, let's go and see..
- Help!

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:43.405
Let me go.

01:04:44.622 --> 01:04:45.653
Help!

01:04:46.028 --> 01:04:47.778
For God's sake, let me go!

01:04:47.986 --> 01:04:49.653
Open the door.
- Let me go.

01:04:49.736 --> 01:04:51.403
Open the door.
- Help!

01:04:52.379 --> 01:04:54.504
For God's sake, let me go!

01:04:55.774 --> 01:04:57.005
Let me go!

01:04:59.236 --> 01:05:00.153
Sir!

01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:02.318
Sir!

01:05:03.028 --> 01:05:07.361
He forcefully entered
my room and tried to molest me.

01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:11.403
I would have been ruined
if you had not come.

01:05:11.486 --> 01:05:14.486
What? She is lying.
I haven't done anything.

01:05:14.736 --> 01:05:17.028
Just ask her what
she's doing in my room.

01:05:17.111 --> 01:05:19.445
What nonsense. This is Madhu's room.

01:05:19.736 --> 01:05:22.195
This is room No.6. Check it yourself.

01:05:26.903 --> 01:05:28.528
This is one of her schemes.

01:05:28.736 --> 01:05:30.528
She is lying.

01:05:33.986 --> 01:05:37.695
Go away from here.
Don't come back here again.

01:05:37.945 --> 01:05:39.111
Get out of here.

01:05:40.111 --> 01:05:41.403
You all, go to your rooms.

01:07:10.028 --> 01:07:12.945
You accused me of molesting you,
didn't you?

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:19.278
I will show you what it really means.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:20.983
No.

01:07:21.986 --> 01:07:25.195
Don't dare to touch me.

01:07:25.945 --> 01:07:27.320
Don't touch me.

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:28.522
No!

01:08:16.907 --> 01:08:18.070
No!

01:08:19.256 --> 01:08:20.539
No!

01:08:37.444 --> 01:08:40.777
Don't dare to touch me.

01:08:41.611 --> 01:08:42.986
I am telling you, stop there.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.360
Look, don't come forward.

01:08:45.861 --> 01:08:48.695
I am telling you, stop there.

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:55.058
Is somebody there! Help!

01:08:56.288 --> 01:08:57.871
Help!

01:08:59.492 --> 01:09:02.072
Is somebody there! Help!

01:09:02.564 --> 01:09:03.755
Help!

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.626
Help!

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.195
Help!

01:09:09.951 --> 01:09:11.471
Help!

01:09:15.658 --> 01:09:17.158
Please let me go.

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.445
Please let me go.

01:09:19.876 --> 01:09:23.190
Forgive me. I will be ruined.

01:09:24.028 --> 01:09:27.778
My purity is at stake. Forgive me.

01:09:28.361 --> 01:09:31.562
Please forgive me.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.277
No!

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:36.572
No. Forgive me. Let me go!

01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:38.465
Please forgive me.

01:09:38.952 --> 01:09:40.361
Please, forgive me.

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:42.328
Let go off me.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:56.528
Now do you understand
what rape means?

01:09:57.945 --> 01:10:02.195
If I want to,
I can ruin your whole life.

01:10:03.903 --> 01:10:08.153
Not only your body.
I can also ruin your self-respect.

01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:14.208
Think about those women
who have suffered from it.

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:18.361
Not only their bodies,
but their souls, are also disgraced.

01:10:20.903 --> 01:10:23.236
You accused me so easily of rape?

01:10:25.736 --> 01:10:27.486
It was just a word for you.

01:10:29.111 --> 01:10:33.486
But this word has spoilt my life.

01:10:34.903 --> 01:10:37.070
I have been disgraced.

01:10:38.653 --> 01:10:42.570
Madhu, you've molested
my reputation and my goodwill.

01:10:47.861 --> 01:10:50.236
But I won't do that with you.

01:10:52.861 --> 01:10:55.986
Because I may make fun of someone..

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.213
..but I can't spoil her sanctity.

01:11:09.153 --> 01:11:11.999
Go away from here.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:07.820
Don't repeat this mistake.

01:12:09.544 --> 01:12:11.503
Because not every boy is Raja.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:26.632
You have done the wrong thing.

01:12:26.986 --> 01:12:31.070
Because of your prank,
Raja's life would have been ruined.

01:12:39.695 --> 01:12:40.781
I'm sorry.

01:12:54.486 --> 01:12:58.778
The weather is so nice here.
I don't want to go back.

01:12:59.528 --> 01:13:00.861
I feel..

01:13:07.552 --> 01:13:09.614
Oh no!
- Madhu, what happened?

01:13:09.695 --> 01:13:12.689
I have hurt my leg.
-What happened?

01:13:13.653 --> 01:13:16.236
Yes, right there. That's where it's
paining. - She has been hurt badly.

01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:19.512
Straighten your leg.
- Oh God!

01:13:27.769 --> 01:13:29.477
Not so hard.

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.448
I have not even touched you.
- Hey, stop.

01:13:38.528 --> 01:13:42.403
What happened to her?
She was squealing right now.

01:14:16.153 --> 01:14:18.820
Nothing.
- What has she written on it?

01:14:18.901 --> 01:14:22.192
What has she written?
- You! - No, Raja!

01:14:23.639 --> 01:14:29.530
"What are you doing at my place?"

01:14:29.702 --> 01:14:31.797
Enjoy yourself. Have a nice time!
- Thank you, sir.

01:14:31.878 --> 01:14:33.880
It seems that the night
will pass by with dancing.

01:14:36.278 --> 01:14:38.403
How do I look?
- You look very handsome.

01:14:38.484 --> 01:14:41.401
Is it? Can any girl
get impressed by me today?

01:14:41.695 --> 01:14:43.986
Hey, you are.. - Can I get a girl today?
- Hey look, look.

01:14:44.336 --> 01:14:46.322
Should we ask them?
- Yes, ask them.

01:14:46.494 --> 01:14:50.937
Divya, tell Raja to meet
me in the lawn behind the hotel.

01:14:53.442 --> 01:14:54.303
Okay.

01:14:56.111 --> 01:15:00.070
Raja, Madhu wants to talk to you.

01:15:02.986 --> 01:15:04.528
Tell her I don't want to meet her.

01:15:07.653 --> 01:15:10.570
Raja has refused to meet you.
I am sorry.

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:34.308
"I can't sleep. I can't sleep."

01:16:34.413 --> 01:16:40.788
"I have no solace. I have no solace."

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.903
"I can't sleep."

01:16:58.412 --> 01:17:01.321
"I can't sleep. I have no solace."

01:17:01.402 --> 01:17:03.777
"Somebody, search for me."

01:17:03.888 --> 01:17:06.680
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:06.903 --> 01:17:09.903
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:10.028 --> 01:17:12.923
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:16.088
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.492
"I can't sleep. I have no solace."

01:17:19.573 --> 01:17:22.031
"Somebody, search for me."

01:17:22.112 --> 01:17:24.946
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:25.119 --> 01:17:28.036
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:28.117 --> 01:17:31.094
"I have lost my heart."

01:17:31.178 --> 01:17:34.470
"I have lost my heart."

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.195
"How do I tell you my condition?"

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:17.320
"I can hardly sleep at night."

01:18:20.486 --> 01:18:26.195
"How do I tell you
about my condition?"

01:18:26.403 --> 01:18:32.320
"I can hardly sleep at night."

01:18:32.585 --> 01:18:35.502
"Ask me about my condition."

01:18:35.588 --> 01:18:38.463
"I am really miserable."

01:18:38.568 --> 01:18:41.526
"Ask me about my condition."

01:18:41.632 --> 01:18:44.049
"I am really miserable."

01:18:44.238 --> 01:18:47.174
"No one is able to
understand my problem."

01:18:47.262 --> 01:18:49.387
"Somebody, search for me."

01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:52.587
"I have lost my heart."

01:18:52.721 --> 01:18:55.429
"I have lost my heart."

01:18:55.645 --> 01:18:58.520
"I have lost my heart."

01:18:58.736 --> 01:19:01.945
"I have lost my heart."

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:50.153
"My heart is more
precious than my life."

01:19:50.657 --> 01:19:56.616
"I can't live a moment without it."

01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:05.153
"My heart is more
precious than my life."

01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:10.986
"I can't live a moment without it."

01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:14.195
"Oh, my God! This is a great pain."

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:17.492
"This pain is very merciless."

01:20:17.642 --> 01:20:20.433
"Oh my God! This is a great pain."

01:20:20.539 --> 01:20:23.123
"This pain is very merciless."

01:20:23.261 --> 01:20:26.152
"It makes me laugh. It makes me cry."

01:20:26.233 --> 01:20:28.608
"Somebody, search for me."

01:20:28.785 --> 01:20:31.618
"I have lost my heart."

01:20:31.699 --> 01:20:34.783
"I have lost my heart."

01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:40.861
"I can't sleep. I can't sleep."

01:20:41.073 --> 01:20:47.073
"I have no solace. I have no solace."

01:20:53.403 --> 01:20:56.367
"I can't sleep. I have no solace."

01:20:56.448 --> 01:20:58.698
"Somebody, search for me."

01:20:58.903 --> 01:21:01.861
"I have lost my heart."

01:21:01.942 --> 01:21:04.942
"I have lost my heart."

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:42.530
Where are you going? What is it?

01:21:42.611 --> 01:21:44.551
Telegram.
- Telegram!

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.445
You must have brought some bad news.

01:21:46.528 --> 01:21:48.528
Sir, this time you
didn't tip me on Diwali?

01:21:48.609 --> 01:21:51.693
I have been ruined and you
want your tips. Give it to me.

01:21:52.403 --> 01:21:54.861
Oh God, take care of me.

01:21:55.236 --> 01:21:58.278
I hope it's not bad news.

01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.153
What happened?

01:22:07.738 --> 01:22:11.196
Madam, come quickly.
Something is wrong with him.

01:22:11.322 --> 01:22:13.572
He is reeling under shocks.
- What happened?

01:22:13.717 --> 01:22:15.236
Something has happened to him.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.653
What happened to you?

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.737
What happened?

01:22:18.903 --> 01:22:20.820
Either my name is not Hazari Prasad..

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:23.186
..or I don't have a son called Raja.

01:22:23.398 --> 01:22:26.074
Someone has played
a nasty prank on me.

01:22:26.185 --> 01:22:27.032
Give it.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.403
It's not a prank. It's true.
- What?

01:22:31.486 --> 01:22:33.945
Raja and Madhu want to get married.
- What are you..

01:22:35.361 --> 01:22:36.611
Read it one more time.

01:22:36.695 --> 01:22:38.695
Raja and Madhu
want to marry each other.

01:22:44.111 --> 01:22:45.236
Not this one!

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.361
The other one.

01:22:51.276 --> 01:22:52.447
Mr. Mehra!

01:22:52.528 --> 01:22:54.611
What happened?

01:22:54.695 --> 01:22:59.070
It's an eighth wonder. Something
impossible has happened.

01:22:59.153 --> 01:23:01.236
Water has caught fire.
The fishes have climbed the trees.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.986
The camels are flying in the sky.

01:23:03.072 --> 01:23:05.514
Raja and Madhu have agreed
to marry each other. - Really.

01:23:05.595 --> 01:23:08.470
Yes.
- This is wonderful!

01:23:08.611 --> 01:23:11.784
Let's get them engaged quickly.

01:23:11.866 --> 01:23:14.866
Not just an engagement.
There will be a grand celebration.

01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:18.072
This city will not have seen
this kind of engagement ceremony.

01:23:18.153 --> 01:23:20.945
This ceremony will be the grandest
of all engagement ceremonies.

01:23:21.028 --> 01:23:22.120
Come, let us celebrate.

01:23:39.903 --> 01:23:44.361
Madhu is my only daughter.

01:23:44.861 --> 01:23:47.320
I am not only her father,
but also her mother.

01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:51.073
I hope you know it's
so difficult to be a mother.

01:23:51.322 --> 01:23:54.322
I am giving you the most
precious of my belongings.

01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:59.989
I will take utmost care of her.
This is a promise.

01:24:00.072 --> 01:24:02.947
Congrats, Mr. Mehra.
- Mahesh.

01:24:03.028 --> 01:24:04.528
Congratulations on
your daughter's engagement.

01:24:04.611 --> 01:24:05.583
Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:24:05.664 --> 01:24:07.664
But I do regret one thing.
- What?

01:24:07.903 --> 01:24:10.611
We could not become relatives.
- That is..

01:24:10.727 --> 01:24:14.072
Shakti and Madhu were friends
since childhood. - Of course.

01:24:14.153 --> 01:24:15.528
That's why I regret it.

01:24:15.688 --> 01:24:18.072
Anyway, I heartily congratulate you.
- Thank you.

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:19.278
Go and get yourself a drink.

01:24:19.361 --> 01:24:20.736
Shakti, you too.
- Yes.

01:24:20.861 --> 01:24:24.278
Hey, Girdhari!
Come, I will introduce you to a friend.

01:24:24.611 --> 01:24:26.931
Girdhari!

01:24:27.403 --> 01:24:28.986
Mehra!

01:24:30.736 --> 01:24:33.129
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:24:39.945 --> 01:24:41.611
What are you staring at?

01:24:41.778 --> 01:24:43.820
He is the groom's father,
Hazari Prasad.

01:24:43.903 --> 01:24:46.945
He is a very old friend of mine,
Girdharilal.

01:24:47.026 --> 01:24:48.276
Greetings.
- Hello.

01:24:48.486 --> 01:24:51.278
I think that I have seen you before.

01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:54.489
You must have seen me
at an inauguration ceremony.

01:24:54.614 --> 01:24:56.197
He is not as he seems.

01:24:56.278 --> 01:24:58.528
He appears very simple,
but he is something else.

01:24:58.806 --> 01:25:01.945
I should take care of other guests.

01:25:02.026 --> 01:25:03.817
Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:25:06.638 --> 01:25:10.538
Have you properly enquired
about him? - Why should I?

01:25:10.619 --> 01:25:11.775
He has textile mills.

01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:14.189
He has chemical factories.
He has a construction business.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.597
He is rich man.

01:25:36.528 --> 01:25:40.778
Have one drink with me.
- Definitely. We shall!

01:25:41.361 --> 01:25:42.736
Hey, brother. Shall we?

01:25:44.622 --> 01:25:45.517
Hello!

01:25:47.153 --> 01:25:49.293
Tell me. When will I get married?

01:25:51.153 --> 01:25:52.548
Quickly.

01:25:56.028 --> 01:25:58.528
The whole world will
see and so will you.

01:25:58.611 --> 01:26:03.401
I will get my son married
to a millionaire's daughter.

01:26:13.905 --> 01:26:15.374
What a cute child.

01:26:15.756 --> 01:26:16.989
How is the drink?
- Fine.

01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:19.109
Excuse me. Mehra, come here.

01:26:19.714 --> 01:26:21.822
Mehra. - Yes?
- I just remembered that..

01:26:21.903 --> 01:26:24.486
You remember everything
after two pegs.

01:26:24.567 --> 01:26:27.114
I am not kidding. I am serious.

01:26:27.195 --> 01:26:29.028
If you care about
your daughter's welfare..

01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:30.734
..then call off this
engagement immediately.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.526
Call off the engagement!
- Yes.

01:26:32.607 --> 01:26:34.486
Are you in your senses?
- Yes, I am..

01:26:34.567 --> 01:26:38.072
..but until you come to your senses,
Hazari Prasad will have looted you.

01:26:38.153 --> 01:26:42.153
What are you saying?
- Yes, he doesn't have any mills.

01:26:42.414 --> 01:26:46.993
He is not a millionaire,
but a junk-shop owner.

01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:48.249
What?
- Yes.

01:27:22.962 --> 01:27:25.629
Actually, he is a junk-shop owner.

01:27:38.965 --> 01:27:42.322
At a party in 1947 when
I danced with Madhubala..

01:27:42.403 --> 01:27:44.349
..people kept watching.

01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:49.097
I think we should go ahead
with the engagement ceremony.

01:27:49.525 --> 01:27:50.778
The auspicious time will pass by.

01:27:50.905 --> 01:27:55.864
I also think so. The engagement
should take place immediately.

01:27:55.945 --> 01:27:58.570
The auspicious time is passing by.
Call Raja and Madhu.

01:27:58.651 --> 01:27:59.859
They will come.

01:27:59.986 --> 01:28:03.156
But I want to introduce
you to some of my guests.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.964
No! I..
- Come.

01:28:07.195 --> 01:28:08.087
Come on.

01:28:10.736 --> 01:28:16.361
Friends, I am very happy
to see all of you here.

01:28:16.695 --> 01:28:18.736
Before the engagement takes place..

01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:21.070
..I'd like to introduce you to..

01:28:21.419 --> 01:28:24.336
..to the groom's father,
Mr. Hazari Prasad.

01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:27.403
He is a very unique person.

01:28:28.257 --> 01:28:34.549
It will take too long
to speak about his greatness.

01:28:35.021 --> 01:28:36.822
Mr. Mehra, you are flattering me.

01:28:37.013 --> 01:28:39.655
We can do this after the engagement.
The auspicious time is passing.

01:28:39.762 --> 01:28:43.179
The time has arrived now.
Just two minutes.

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:49.945
Friends, Mr. Hazari Prasad
who has many chemical factories..

01:28:50.236 --> 01:28:52.445
..who has many textile mills..

01:28:52.653 --> 01:28:56.486
..and who is one of the
richest people in this city.

01:28:57.104 --> 01:29:02.417
In reality,
he is a cheap junk-shop owner.

01:29:03.528 --> 01:29:05.236
A junk-shop owner.

01:29:06.236 --> 01:29:11.111
The junk..
where we sell our old newspapers!

01:29:12.286 --> 01:29:17.572
Where we sell the old bottles,
torn clothes.

01:29:17.737 --> 01:29:21.862
Broken furniture.
These are the things he sells.

01:29:21.986 --> 01:29:24.778
How dare..

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:29.153
..he dream of becoming
my daughter's father-in-law?

01:29:29.236 --> 01:29:32.778
You are insulting
me in front of everyone.

01:29:32.861 --> 01:29:36.653
Insult! Only those get insulted
who have some self-respect.

01:29:36.736 --> 01:29:38.278
You have none.
- Mehra!

01:29:38.403 --> 01:29:40.737
Shut your mouth!

01:29:42.861 --> 01:29:45.153
And listen more about this fraudster!

01:29:45.611 --> 01:29:50.611
This conman wanted to
take away my wealth in dowry.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.163
So that I become penniless.

01:29:52.244 --> 01:29:54.415
Mehra, if you say one more word,
then.. - Then!

01:30:11.153 --> 01:30:12.903
Daddy, what have you done?

01:30:13.094 --> 01:30:16.053
He was going to ruin us.

01:30:16.134 --> 01:30:20.158
Thank God, your life was
saved from being destroyed.

01:30:21.486 --> 01:30:24.778
This world will change.

01:30:25.778 --> 01:30:27.611
The stars will change.

01:30:28.195 --> 01:30:29.570
The earth and the sky
will also change..

01:30:29.653 --> 01:30:33.278
..but Hazari Prasad
won't forget this insult.

01:30:34.523 --> 01:30:40.190
Hazari Prasad will
remember it forever.

01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:46.653
One day he will make you pay for this.
I'll surly make you pay for this.

01:30:47.575 --> 01:30:48.582
Raja, let's go.

01:30:56.798 --> 01:30:58.903
Excuse me, Madam.
I want to meet Mr. Mehra.

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:02.486
He is very busy right now.
- It's very important that I meet him.

01:31:02.695 --> 01:31:05.986
I must meet him.
- Okay, wait here. I will just check up.

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:07.905
Write to Bennet and Miranda that..

01:31:07.986 --> 01:31:10.903
..we liked their proposals
and ask them to send the details.

01:31:11.095 --> 01:31:12.169
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:14.666
Someone called Raja
wants to meet you.

01:31:17.153 --> 01:31:21.153
Tell him that I don't
have time to meet him.

01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:23.278
Okay, sir. I am sorry.

01:31:23.361 --> 01:31:24.320
So what was I saying?

01:31:24.403 --> 01:31:25.570
You were saying something
about Bennet and Miranda.

01:31:25.653 --> 01:31:27.073
I want to say something to you.

01:31:27.155 --> 01:31:30.447
Write to them that we are not
at all interested in their proposal.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:32.755
Sir, listen to me.
- Write to them..

01:31:32.836 --> 01:31:35.763
..that talking further
about this is useless.

01:31:35.945 --> 01:31:37.700
It would be just
the waste of my time.

01:31:37.781 --> 01:31:40.213
You have an issue with my father.
Why are you punishing me?

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:42.736
Write further that
it was our mistake..

01:31:42.817 --> 01:31:44.736
..to think they were
capable of this proposal.

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.361
Had I known earlier that
they were so unfit and cheats..

01:31:48.442 --> 01:31:51.317
Should I also write that?
- Note it down, Varma. - Yes, sir.

01:31:51.779 --> 01:31:53.862
At least think about Madhu.

01:31:53.986 --> 01:31:55.236
Why are you spoiling her life?

01:31:55.371 --> 01:31:59.829
Also write to them that we
don't need their cheap advice. - Right.

01:32:00.903 --> 01:32:02.445
Then listen to me.

01:32:02.653 --> 01:32:05.861
Like other marriages take
place without your permission..

01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:08.903
..this marriage will take
place without your permission too.

01:32:09.083 --> 01:32:12.417
So, finally you've
shown your true colours.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:17.903
If you drag this matter
further I will get you killed.

01:32:18.319 --> 01:32:19.995
I am talking to you
politely and you..

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:21.954
Will you teach me about propriety?

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.572
You have to be born
with good manners.

01:32:24.653 --> 01:32:28.861
You and your father
have no manners at all.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.903
Mr. Mehra, I used to
respect you a lot.

01:32:33.486 --> 01:32:38.028
But you are a very cheap person.

01:32:38.361 --> 01:32:39.565
What did you say?

01:32:54.088 --> 01:32:55.380
Call the police!

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:58.035
Get the security!

01:33:05.736 --> 01:33:07.653
Stop this now!

01:33:15.861 --> 01:33:17.243
Just stop it!

01:33:27.945 --> 01:33:31.736
'There was a house here earlier,
but looks like ruins now.'

01:33:31.945 --> 01:33:35.570
'Your face looks like
the battlefield.'

01:33:35.653 --> 01:33:37.446
Wonderful. Wonderful.

01:33:37.602 --> 01:33:39.376
He fell down.
- Hey!

01:33:40.236 --> 01:33:43.153
What's going on?

01:33:44.195 --> 01:33:48.048
'You are responsible
for all this mess.'

01:33:48.199 --> 01:33:51.282
'You are responsible
for his torn pants.'

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:54.204
'Don't assume you
will escape punishment.'

01:33:54.306 --> 01:33:57.728
'I am Ghalib,
the protector of the law!' - Wonderful!

01:33:57.809 --> 01:34:00.665
This is the guy.
Inspector, arrest him.

01:34:01.239 --> 01:34:02.614
Arrest him.

01:34:02.695 --> 01:34:04.111
He creates a chaos.

01:34:04.195 --> 01:34:07.361
I will put him in jail
and teach him a lesson.

01:34:07.736 --> 01:34:10.915
What? Father has put
Raja in prison. - Yes.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:14.945
Isn't your father a lawyer?

01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:16.572
Let's bail him out.

01:34:16.653 --> 01:34:19.611
My father can't bail him out today.
- Why?

01:34:19.788 --> 01:34:22.829
Because today is Saturday.
The courts will open only on Monday.

01:34:23.481 --> 01:34:24.898
Oh my God!

01:34:25.361 --> 01:34:28.153
Raja will have to
spend two days in prison.

01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:37.915
Hey!

01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:42.626
Are you trying to commit suicide?

01:34:42.707 --> 01:34:44.821
I will put you behind bars.
- Please do it.

01:34:44.903 --> 01:34:47.028
No! I won't.
I am in a good mood today.

01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:49.195
Yes. Come on!
- Listen!

01:34:49.322 --> 01:34:50.796
Under which other crime
can you put me in prison?

01:34:50.877 --> 01:34:52.890
In what crime? Tell her.
- If you kill someone.

01:34:52.996 --> 01:34:55.159
If you pickpocket.
- If you rape someone.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.405
Also if you hit any officer.
- Oh! Thank you.

01:35:01.114 --> 01:35:04.864
You hit him really hard!
- Thank you.

01:35:04.952 --> 01:35:09.368
She has hit me. Now I will hit her.
- Yes, sure.

01:35:10.528 --> 01:35:12.903
How dare you hit me?

01:35:13.111 --> 01:35:13.959
You!

01:35:16.347 --> 01:35:18.847
That was really hard.
I won't spare you.

01:35:18.961 --> 01:35:21.920
Help me! Help me!

01:35:26.695 --> 01:35:29.101
I won't spare you.

01:35:30.914 --> 01:35:31.765
Yes.

01:35:32.153 --> 01:35:35.328
Civil police riots! I will
put you in prison for causing riots!

01:35:35.409 --> 01:35:37.867
Section 920, come on!

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.403
After coming in here all
women stick to the right path.

01:35:42.579 --> 01:35:44.329
You too will learn your lesson.

01:35:45.903 --> 01:35:47.945
Come on! Get inside.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.153
Raja!

01:35:59.778 --> 01:36:01.695
Madhu, why are you here?

01:36:01.778 --> 01:36:03.570
Do you remember both
of us had taken an oath?

01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:05.528
Both of us will always be together.

01:36:05.611 --> 01:36:12.115
That's why you were
so eager to come to prison.

01:36:12.195 --> 01:36:14.361
The world has become so cruel..

01:36:14.653 --> 01:36:19.070
..that prison is the only
place we can meet peacefully.

01:36:19.188 --> 01:36:22.188
I had thought love had
vanished from the world.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.611
But both of you have
made me forget my duty.

01:36:26.903 --> 01:36:31.278
I am the protector of
all the lovers in this world.

01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:35.070
Anybody who tries to
destroy your love..

01:36:35.236 --> 01:36:38.695
..will face my fury.

01:36:39.246 --> 01:36:40.954
Inspector!
- Yes.

01:36:41.072 --> 01:36:43.405
Where is my son? I am asking you,
where's my son, inspector?

01:36:43.486 --> 01:36:45.736
His mother must know.
- My son's name is Raja.

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:49.028
For what crime have you put him in jail?
Set him free.

01:36:49.111 --> 01:36:51.653
Is he your son?

01:36:55.361 --> 01:36:58.028
What is this girl doing in there?
- Laying eggs.

01:36:58.111 --> 01:36:59.820
What?
- She's laying eggs!

01:36:59.903 --> 01:37:00.734
Madhu!

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:08.820
Who has dared to put
my daughter behind bars?

01:37:08.903 --> 01:37:11.986
I did! I am the station
master in-charge, Mr. Ghalib!

01:37:12.218 --> 01:37:14.614
I don't care who you are.

01:37:14.749 --> 01:37:16.788
You will set my daughter
free right now.

01:37:16.869 --> 01:37:18.489
First my son should be set free.

01:37:18.570 --> 01:37:21.445
First my daughter.
- My son! - Quiet!

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:26.111
Neither your son will be
set free nor your daughter. - Why?

01:37:26.445 --> 01:37:32.280
Because no one can be bailed
on a Saturday or a Sunday.

01:37:32.361 --> 01:37:36.073
Neither a friend nor
a buddy can I set free.

01:37:36.153 --> 01:37:38.361
Wonderful!
- Quiet!

01:37:38.997 --> 01:37:42.921
I don't care about the bail.
I'll call up the commissioner right now.

01:37:43.736 --> 01:37:46.820
I can't compromise on my duty.

01:37:46.953 --> 01:37:50.578
I can't set them free without bail.

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.965
Wow!
- Very good! Very good!

01:37:53.111 --> 01:37:54.861
Such a shameless girl she is..

01:37:54.945 --> 01:37:57.570
..she didn't leave my son
in the jail too. Shameless girl!

01:37:57.653 --> 01:37:59.903
His son is shameless, tell him.

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:02.122
Useless, thug, vagabond, loafer.

01:38:02.203 --> 01:38:05.062
Hey, dare you call my son a loafer.
- Shut up!

01:38:06.195 --> 01:38:10.403
This is not your house.
It is a police station.

01:38:10.548 --> 01:38:13.215
I'll put you behind
bars if you talk too much.

01:38:13.445 --> 01:38:15.903
Learn a lesson from your children.

01:38:16.195 --> 01:38:20.570
Look! They are so much in love.

01:38:24.028 --> 01:38:25.403
Madhu!
- Raja!

01:38:25.486 --> 01:38:27.179
What is this?
- What is this?

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.234
This is love.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.655
Inspector, stop them.
- Stop them, Ghalib.

01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:34.403
Two love birds love
each other in a cage.

01:38:34.652 --> 01:38:38.000
Two fools are cribbing
over it outside.

01:38:38.081 --> 01:38:39.250
Inspector!

01:39:24.775 --> 01:39:29.609
"We are lovers."

01:39:29.898 --> 01:39:34.731
"We are not scared of the world."

01:39:34.931 --> 01:39:39.764
"We are lovers."

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:44.585
"We are not scared of the world."

01:39:44.723 --> 01:39:50.140
"We are not scared of the world."

01:39:50.338 --> 01:39:55.213
"We will make other people jealous."

01:39:55.403 --> 01:40:00.236
"We will live and die in love."

01:40:00.399 --> 01:40:05.190
"We will make other people jealous."

01:40:05.308 --> 01:40:09.808
"We will live and die in love."

01:40:09.889 --> 01:40:14.473
"We are lovers."

01:40:14.735 --> 01:40:19.276
"We are not scared of the world."

01:40:19.653 --> 01:40:25.070
"We are not scared of the world."

01:40:25.155 --> 01:40:30.072
"We will make other people jealous."

01:40:30.153 --> 01:40:34.903
"We will live and die in love."

01:40:35.057 --> 01:40:39.891
"We will make other people jealous."

01:40:40.111 --> 01:40:45.528
"We will live and die in love."

01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:35.986
"No prison can stop lovers
from loving."

01:41:38.528 --> 01:41:48.111
"No prison can stop
lovers from loving."

01:41:48.361 --> 01:41:53.320
"It's no joke to love
someone in this world."

01:41:53.403 --> 01:41:58.695
"It's no joke to love
someone in this world."

01:41:58.986 --> 01:42:03.736
"Who has succeeded
in stopping the wind?"

01:42:03.986 --> 01:42:08.986
"Who has stopped
the clouds from moving?"

01:42:09.186 --> 01:42:14.142
"We'll break the cage
and we will fly away."

01:42:14.236 --> 01:42:18.778
"We will never be caught again."

01:42:18.903 --> 01:42:23.653
"We will make other people jealous."

01:42:23.986 --> 01:42:28.570
"We will live and die in love."

01:42:28.778 --> 01:42:33.827
"We will make other people jealous."

01:42:33.959 --> 01:42:40.042
"We will live and die in love."

01:43:09.278 --> 01:43:11.695
"I am not Juliet."

01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:14.195
"Nor is he Romeo."

01:43:14.316 --> 01:43:19.316
"We won't bear the
injustice with a smile."

01:43:21.903 --> 01:43:24.361
"I am not Juliet."

01:43:24.486 --> 01:43:26.663
"Nor is he Romeo."

01:43:26.943 --> 01:43:31.683
"We won't bear the
injustice with a smile."

01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:36.728
"No one can stop us.
Our union will be successful."

01:43:36.889 --> 01:43:41.764
"No one can stop us.
Our union will be successful."

01:43:42.175 --> 01:43:47.133
"We have fallen in love."

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:51.986
"We won't be scared of the world."

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:57.403
"On the strength of our love.."

01:43:57.508 --> 01:44:01.800
"..we will make the
world bow in front of us."

01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:06.486
"We will make other people jealous."

01:44:06.979 --> 01:44:11.729
"We will live and die in love."

01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:16.403
"We will make other people jealous."

01:44:16.736 --> 01:44:21.986
"We will live and die in love."

01:45:03.986 --> 01:45:05.596
It seems they have
met with an accident.

01:45:05.943 --> 01:45:08.063
Should we see?
- Yes, come.

01:45:58.072 --> 01:46:01.260
I thought you were immature.

01:46:01.486 --> 01:46:02.861
I tried to make you
understand lovingly.

01:46:03.153 --> 01:46:04.986
But today you crossed all limits.

01:46:05.283 --> 01:46:09.030
You will have to pay
the price for this.

01:46:09.195 --> 01:46:13.237
One doesn't pay the price for love,
Mr. Mehra.

01:46:13.707 --> 01:46:15.957
One worships it.

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:18.827
You were successful
in stopping us this time.

01:46:19.293 --> 01:46:23.322
But till we are alive,
we will keep meeting each other.

01:46:23.506 --> 01:46:26.435
You will try only when
your hands and legs will be fine.

01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:30.070
Teach him a good lesson so that
he never comes back to my daughter.

01:46:30.307 --> 01:46:31.724
Madhu, come with me.

01:46:43.634 --> 01:46:44.675
Raja!

01:46:52.486 --> 01:46:53.861
Let go off me!

01:47:05.945 --> 01:47:07.986
Let go off me!

01:47:11.868 --> 01:47:12.724
Madhu!

01:47:29.528 --> 01:47:30.736
Let go off him!

01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:32.486
Let go off my Raja!

01:47:33.361 --> 01:47:36.448
Let go off him! No!

01:47:36.896 --> 01:47:38.146
Let go off him!

01:47:38.528 --> 01:47:40.028
Raja! - Shut up, Madhu!

01:47:41.695 --> 01:47:42.986
Come with me!

01:47:47.072 --> 01:47:48.656
Get inside!

01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:50.445
Let go off him! - Get in! - Raja!

01:47:50.531 --> 01:47:51.396
Raja.

01:48:21.611 --> 01:48:24.445
You dare step out of the house today.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:27.195
I will break your legs.
- Then break them!

01:48:27.796 --> 01:48:29.947
If you break my legs then I
will leave with the help of my hands.

01:48:30.028 --> 01:48:31.778
If you will cut off my hands
then I will go with the help of my head.

01:48:31.903 --> 01:48:33.564
Even if you cut off
my head still my..

01:48:33.645 --> 01:48:35.855
..writhing body would
find a way to reach to Raja.

01:48:36.486 --> 01:48:38.320
You said that scum's name again?

01:48:38.695 --> 01:48:40.528
As of now,
I have just broken his bones.

01:48:40.945 --> 01:48:44.153
But if he does not mend his
ways then I will cut him into pieces.

01:48:45.111 --> 01:48:47.236
If you only touch my Raja..

01:48:47.653 --> 01:48:49.903
..then you'll repent
it for the rest of your life.

01:48:52.126 --> 01:48:55.209
I see, a daughter is
threatening father?

01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:58.820
What will you do?

01:48:59.647 --> 01:49:02.188
Want to see what I can do?

01:49:05.575 --> 01:49:06.735
Dear..

01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:21.142
Madhu! What are you doing?

01:49:21.223 --> 01:49:22.405
Grandma, let go off me.

01:49:22.486 --> 01:49:25.946
If Raja is hurt,
then I'll kill myself.

01:49:27.945 --> 01:49:30.861
Let go off me!

01:49:33.736 --> 01:49:36.778
Let go off me!
Did you see what can I do?

01:49:38.111 --> 01:49:40.945
You couldn't bear me crying..

01:49:42.111 --> 01:49:44.028
..now see my blood.

01:49:45.153 --> 01:49:48.361
Have a look. Have a look.

01:49:48.445 --> 01:49:50.695
Madhu! Madhu!

01:49:50.945 --> 01:49:52.611
Madhu, dear.

01:49:52.736 --> 01:49:55.820
Enough! I cannot tolerate it anymore!

01:49:55.945 --> 01:49:58.499
But uncle, will she agree to go?

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:01.622
If she doesn't agree,
then I will take her forcefully.

01:50:01.778 --> 01:50:03.195
She's had her way until now.

01:50:03.278 --> 01:50:06.302
She thinks that I will
be pacified by her craze.

01:50:06.383 --> 01:50:08.864
I will never let my daughter,
Madhu, get married..

01:50:08.945 --> 01:50:10.486
..to that scum, Hazari Prasad's son.

01:50:10.611 --> 01:50:13.361
I will take my daughter so far away..

01:50:13.486 --> 01:50:16.028
..that neither can he
nor his memories go that far.

01:50:16.201 --> 01:50:17.951
You got the tickets?
- Yes, Uncle.

01:50:18.736 --> 01:50:20.322
What time is the flight?
- Exactly after three hours.

01:50:20.487 --> 01:50:23.279
Three hours!
Here every moment is difficult to pass.

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:26.375
Ask Shankar to pack
Madhu's belongings.

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:30.445
No. This cannot happen.

01:50:30.827 --> 01:50:32.994
No one can separate Madhu from me.

01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:38.178
Hey! Where are you going?

01:51:05.445 --> 01:51:07.903
Raja!

01:51:08.913 --> 01:51:10.788
You have come, Raja.

01:51:11.528 --> 01:51:13.403
I had lost all hope!

01:51:14.403 --> 01:51:16.820
Papa wants to take me away from you.

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:21.070
I'll die,
but I won't go with him, Raja!

01:51:21.153 --> 01:51:23.820
No, Madhu. Don't worry.

01:51:24.697 --> 01:51:27.288
Now that I have come.
Everything will be all right.

01:51:30.486 --> 01:51:32.820
Raja, they have come, Raja!

01:51:33.153 --> 01:51:35.320
Please save me. Hide me somewhere.

01:51:35.403 --> 01:51:37.486
I won't go. Hide me somewhere, Raja!

01:51:37.611 --> 01:51:39.028
You swine!

01:51:39.695 --> 01:51:43.195
You dared to come
into my daughter's room!

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:47.986
Whichever part of your body has
touched her, I'll make pieces of them!

01:51:48.111 --> 01:51:50.570
Today, your death
has brought you here.

01:51:50.695 --> 01:51:52.528
Your dead body will
go out of this house!

01:51:52.653 --> 01:51:54.361
I'll kill you, you scumbag!

01:51:54.486 --> 01:51:56.240
I'll kill you!

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.455
"Chants"

01:53:53.323 --> 01:53:55.067
No! - Move, Mother!

01:54:01.421 --> 01:54:04.879
Shoot, Papa.
Now we don't fear anything.

01:54:04.992 --> 01:54:07.409
We have done what we had to do.

01:54:07.612 --> 01:54:09.987
Now you can do what you want to do.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.820
What if we couldn't live together?
We can die together.

01:54:42.772 --> 01:54:43.855
Son.

01:54:44.570 --> 01:54:48.654
Forget whatever has happened,
think of it as God's will.

01:54:49.903 --> 01:54:51.486
Forgive him.

01:54:52.225 --> 01:54:55.100
After all, she too is dear to you.

01:54:55.698 --> 01:55:00.240
Oh Mother, she who was dear to me..

01:55:01.218 --> 01:55:03.760
..has broken my heart to pieces.

01:55:04.361 --> 01:55:06.736
The one whom I thought
was the depth of my eyes..

01:55:07.486 --> 01:55:10.570
..has blackened my face.

01:55:11.486 --> 01:55:13.153
Tell her to go away from here.

01:55:14.028 --> 01:55:18.570
I will think that,
like my wife, my daughter too is dead.

01:55:26.477 --> 01:55:28.143
Raja still hasn't come.

01:55:28.489 --> 01:55:29.489
Vitthal
- Yes?

01:55:29.657 --> 01:55:31.307
Has he told you when he will come?

01:55:31.388 --> 01:55:34.364
He didn't tell me anything.
- It's late evening and..

01:55:52.153 --> 01:55:53.195
Mother.

01:55:55.945 --> 01:55:57.861
There was no other way, Mother.

01:55:58.903 --> 01:56:00.361
Madhu and I have married.

01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:05.753
Bless you, children.

01:56:07.195 --> 01:56:12.111
You did well. The one you
loved you made her your life partner.

01:56:12.195 --> 01:56:13.903
You wait. Vitthal.
- Yes.

01:56:13.986 --> 01:56:16.570
Get the candle for prayer.
- I'll just get it, Mother.

01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.856
Whom are you welcoming, Savitri?

01:56:20.098 --> 01:56:23.640
Her, who is the daughter
of the serpent who bit me?

01:56:24.028 --> 01:56:25.820
Or the light of my clan..

01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:30.070
..who has adorned the
parting of my enemy's daughter?

01:56:30.278 --> 01:56:31.820
Both of them cannot
stay in this house.

01:56:31.945 --> 01:56:33.986
Get out of here!
- What are you saying?

01:56:34.239 --> 01:56:35.822
Raja is our only son.

01:56:35.903 --> 01:56:39.736
Then tell your only son,
that if he wants to stay in this house..

01:56:39.861 --> 01:56:42.695
..then throw her back
to where he brought her from.

01:56:42.903 --> 01:56:44.903
I can't leave Madhu.

01:56:45.028 --> 01:56:46.986
Then you will have
to leave this house.

01:56:50.153 --> 01:56:51.278
Come on, Madhu.

01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:55.153
Wait, Raja.
- Let him go!

01:56:55.528 --> 01:56:58.361
We'll think we had no son.
We were childless.

01:56:58.550 --> 01:57:00.711
Go. From today,
I'm throwing you out of my house..

01:57:00.792 --> 01:57:03.003
..my life and my property. Go.

01:57:10.562 --> 01:57:14.562
Today, I have realised that I am the
son of a man with such a small heart..

01:57:15.533 --> 01:57:19.241
..who doesn't even have
a blessing to give his son.

01:57:20.945 --> 01:57:24.945
Go, but remember. The door
through which you are going today..

01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:28.278
..you will have to grovel
at the same door to come in one day.

01:58:02.846 --> 01:58:07.263
"We have left our house."

01:58:07.570 --> 01:58:12.153
"We have broken the customs."

01:58:12.481 --> 01:58:16.773
"We have left our house."

01:58:17.153 --> 01:58:21.611
"We have broken the customs."

01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:25.966
"We will go away somewhere very far."

01:58:26.111 --> 01:58:31.236
"We will settle our new life there."

01:58:31.486 --> 01:58:35.903
"We have left our house."

01:58:36.027 --> 01:58:40.697
"We have broken the customs."

01:58:40.858 --> 01:58:44.861
"We will go away somewhere very far."

01:58:44.986 --> 01:58:49.778
"We will settle our new life there."

01:58:50.252 --> 01:58:54.544
"We have left our house."

01:58:54.903 --> 01:58:59.820
"We have broken the customs."

01:59:28.322 --> 01:59:33.322
"If I have to live without you.."

01:59:33.508 --> 01:59:37.778
"..my heart will never agree."

01:59:42.695 --> 01:59:47.611
"If I have to live without you.."

01:59:47.736 --> 01:59:51.736
"..my heart will never agree."

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:57.017
"Let there be any
storm or any hurdle."

01:59:57.153 --> 02:00:01.403
"It will not be able to separate us."

02:00:01.528 --> 02:00:06.294
"I have just done it once.
I have fallen in love with you."

02:00:06.391 --> 02:00:10.766
"I have just done it once.
I have fallen in love with you."

02:00:10.986 --> 02:00:19.945
"Now I will forget all the
worldly pleasures in your arms."

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.528
"We have left our house."

02:00:24.919 --> 02:00:29.127
"We have broken the customs."

02:01:25.736 --> 02:01:28.208
"The ceiling's of love."

02:01:28.289 --> 02:01:30.622
"The floor's of our heart."

02:01:30.789 --> 02:01:35.039
"We have the tall
walls of our dreams."

02:01:40.044 --> 02:01:42.252
"The ceilings of love."

02:01:42.394 --> 02:01:44.923
"The floors of our heart."

02:01:45.004 --> 02:01:49.087
"We have the tall
walls of our dreams."

02:01:49.361 --> 02:01:54.361
"The buds of
our love are blossoming."

02:01:54.486 --> 02:01:58.361
"The beautiful moment
of our union has arrived."

02:01:58.653 --> 02:02:01.070
"Quench my thirst of
many generations."

02:02:01.153 --> 02:02:03.320
"Embrace me tightly."

02:02:03.445 --> 02:02:05.695
"Quench my thirst of
many generations."

02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.153
"Embrace me tightly."

02:02:08.236 --> 02:02:17.195
"We will decorate this temple
of love with our affection"

02:02:17.534 --> 02:02:21.951
"We have left our house"

02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:26.653
"We have broken the customs."

02:02:56.658 --> 02:03:00.575
Madhu! Come out! Hurry!
The food is ready.

02:03:02.296 --> 02:03:03.573
Oh, my God!

02:03:04.153 --> 02:03:05.653
On the basis of this
beautiful roti (Indian bread).

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:08.070
I will definitely get
a cook's job in the Hotel Taj.

02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:11.070
What are you doing?

02:03:11.153 --> 02:03:13.986
My dream cook,
I am paying you for your services.

02:03:14.487 --> 02:03:16.279
If you will keep
paying me in this way..

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:19.030
..then I will stop cooking
and start doing something else.

02:03:19.111 --> 02:03:21.965
This is the bonus
and this is your tip.

02:03:24.285 --> 02:03:26.160
You have provoked me.

02:03:26.278 --> 02:03:28.653
You have provoked me
early in the morning, Madhu.

02:03:29.195 --> 02:03:30.903
Now I will not spare you.

02:03:32.432 --> 02:03:35.016
Wow! From where did
you bring these bangles?

02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:38.855
Why should I tell you?
It is a top secret.

02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:41.465
Really! A top secret!

02:03:42.153 --> 02:03:43.611
Won't you tell me?
- No.

02:03:44.244 --> 02:03:46.661
I will reveal all
your secrets right now.

02:03:52.570 --> 02:03:54.153
Won't you tell me? - No.

02:03:54.445 --> 02:03:55.279
Okay.

02:03:57.361 --> 02:03:58.945
I won't tell you.
- Won't you tell me?

02:03:59.217 --> 02:04:01.111
Fine. Fine. I will tell you.

02:04:01.286 --> 02:04:02.583
I will tell you.

02:04:06.259 --> 02:04:07.800
Mother had come here yesterday.

02:04:08.932 --> 02:04:10.057
Really?

02:04:10.347 --> 02:04:12.097
She only gave me these bangles.

02:04:12.822 --> 02:04:14.322
She told me that a
married woman's wrist..

02:04:14.403 --> 02:04:15.736
..should never be
void of any bangles.

02:04:21.403 --> 02:04:23.820
What happened, Raja?

02:04:25.111 --> 02:04:28.028
Madhu, return these bangles.

02:04:28.747 --> 02:04:31.247
Return them! Why?

02:04:31.822 --> 02:04:33.197
These are mother's blessings.

02:04:33.303 --> 02:04:34.803
No doubt these are
mother's blessings.

02:04:35.263 --> 02:04:37.013
But the gold belongs to my father.

02:04:37.486 --> 02:04:39.153
I am not greedy for gold, Raja.

02:04:39.653 --> 02:04:42.111
I just didn't want to
insult mother's feelings.

02:04:42.195 --> 02:04:44.070
You are misunderstanding me, Madhu!

02:04:44.361 --> 02:04:45.820
Even I don't want to
insult mother's feelings.

02:04:45.938 --> 02:04:47.854
But that's what you are doing.
- No, Madhu.

02:04:48.195 --> 02:04:50.445
The man who has not
accepted you till now..

02:04:50.528 --> 02:04:53.098
I can never accept the bangles
that have come from his house.

02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:57.236
We just want their blessings.
Not their wealth.

02:04:57.398 --> 02:04:59.231
You are just speaking rubbish, Raja.

02:04:59.486 --> 02:05:01.115
I will not take off these bangles.

02:05:01.195 --> 02:05:02.736
Then I will have to take them off!

02:05:06.486 --> 02:05:10.578
Fine. So then you go
and return these bangles. Go!

02:05:30.736 --> 02:05:33.320
I have not behaved
properly with Raja.

02:05:34.486 --> 02:05:36.403
Without any reason, I made him upset.

02:05:37.486 --> 02:05:40.320
Poor guy.
He left without even eating anything.

02:05:41.903 --> 02:05:45.403
When he comes back,
I'll ask him to forgive me.

02:05:45.969 --> 02:05:47.802
I will feed him with my own hands.

02:05:51.188 --> 02:05:52.521
It is evening now.

02:05:53.331 --> 02:05:55.331
Why hasn't Raja come back yet?

02:05:56.028 --> 02:05:57.445
Did anything happen..

02:05:57.738 --> 02:06:00.280
No. This cannot happen.

02:06:00.986 --> 02:06:02.653
He has gotten angry
with me and went away.

02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:03.986
Wherever he is right now..

02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:05.986
..I will convince
him and bring him back.

02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:11.986
Ramu hit his son a lot.
I was unable to tolerate it.

02:06:12.153 --> 02:06:15.246
I explained it to him well.
But he did not understand.

02:06:15.486 --> 02:06:17.111
He went on hitting him.
- Uncle!

02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:20.361
Did Raja come here?
- No, daughter. He did not come here.

02:06:21.736 --> 02:06:23.153
Then where did he go?

02:06:23.736 --> 02:06:24.986
What happened, dear?

02:08:09.153 --> 02:08:10.653
Where were you for such a long time?

02:08:11.861 --> 02:08:12.780
Answer me!

02:08:16.153 --> 02:08:18.111
Madhu, I..
- Don't touch me!

02:08:18.778 --> 02:08:20.611
What do you think of yourself?

02:08:21.153 --> 02:08:24.073
Did you even think once, how tense
I would be? What would I go through?

02:08:24.153 --> 02:08:26.486
Madhu, listen to me at least.
- To hell with Madhu.

02:08:27.195 --> 02:08:29.945
Because of a small mistake,
you left me and went away.

02:08:30.405 --> 02:08:33.614
Is this your love for me?
Am I worth only this much?

02:08:33.695 --> 02:08:36.445
No, Madhu. It is not like that.
- I don't want to hear anything.

02:08:38.070 --> 02:08:40.361
Did we leave home for this?

02:08:41.621 --> 02:08:42.954
You don't know that..

02:08:43.111 --> 02:08:45.903
..in these small moments
I have died many deaths.

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:47.905
I will never forgive you.

02:08:47.986 --> 02:08:49.831
I hate you! I hate you!

02:08:50.263 --> 02:08:52.721
I hate you! I hate you!

02:08:54.153 --> 02:08:55.781
I hate you!

02:09:16.925 --> 02:09:20.133
Didn't mother tell you that..

02:09:21.361 --> 02:09:25.070
..a married woman's wrist
should never be void of any bangles?

02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:34.379
I am sorry. Please forgive me.

02:09:37.111 --> 02:09:38.249
I am sorry.

02:09:40.794 --> 02:09:44.505
Promise me that you
will never leave me.

02:09:47.070 --> 02:09:49.111
I don't want anything
else besides you.

02:09:49.736 --> 02:09:51.111
Nothing else!

02:09:52.111 --> 02:09:53.820
I love you, Raja!

02:10:00.195 --> 02:10:01.152
Madhu!

02:10:06.570 --> 02:10:08.653
I am really hungry.

02:10:10.172 --> 02:10:11.797
I did not eat anything since morning.

02:10:39.307 --> 02:10:40.306
Raja!

02:10:41.486 --> 02:10:43.445
I have come to meet you.

02:10:45.945 --> 02:10:48.778
I have come to meet you.

02:10:51.653 --> 02:10:52.736
I..

02:10:57.655 --> 02:10:59.614
Aunt. Oh Aunt!

02:10:59.701 --> 02:11:01.284
What is the matter, Madhu?

02:11:02.112 --> 02:11:05.487
My husband is working
on the 12th floor.

02:11:05.826 --> 02:11:07.867
I want to tell him something.

02:11:07.986 --> 02:11:10.736
You please tell him.
He is unable to hear me.

02:11:10.886 --> 02:11:12.261
What do you want to tell him?

02:11:12.516 --> 02:11:16.516
Tell him that I love you.

02:11:16.695 --> 02:11:18.237
Oh my God!

02:11:21.028 --> 02:11:24.695
Silly girl,
have you come so far to say this?

02:11:24.945 --> 02:11:28.070
Fine. All right.
I will tell him that.

02:11:28.192 --> 02:11:31.484
Ramu's father! Can you hear me?

02:11:31.570 --> 02:11:33.695
What is the matter, Laajo?

02:11:33.945 --> 02:11:36.153
I love you.

02:11:36.398 --> 02:11:37.311
What?

02:11:40.293 --> 02:11:43.278
I was eager to hear this
since the last 25 years.

02:11:43.403 --> 02:11:45.278
Shall we take a holiday and go home?

02:11:45.989 --> 02:11:47.864
I am not saying that.

02:11:47.989 --> 02:11:53.197
The girl downstairs wants
to say this to her husband.

02:11:53.278 --> 02:11:56.403
Oh my Laajo!
I've become excited after 25 years.

02:11:56.528 --> 02:11:59.111
But you ruined all my intentions.

02:11:59.528 --> 02:12:00.653
Never mind!

02:12:00.778 --> 02:12:04.073
Raja, my son!
- What is the matter, Uncle?

02:12:04.153 --> 02:12:07.073
Your wife has sent a message for you.

02:12:07.153 --> 02:12:09.028
She says I love you.

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:19.818
Uncle, tell her that I
have liked her style very much.

02:12:20.361 --> 02:12:23.155
As a reward,
I am coming down to kiss her.

02:12:23.236 --> 02:12:24.611
All right.

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:26.611
Oh my Laajo!
- What is the matter?

02:12:26.736 --> 02:12:29.153
I am coming down to kiss you.

02:12:29.486 --> 02:12:30.364
Oh my God!

02:12:32.155 --> 02:12:34.322
You enjoyed it, right, Laajo?

02:12:34.487 --> 02:12:37.529
Shut up! You are very shameless.

02:12:38.528 --> 02:12:41.070
Is this the thing to
be said in front of everyone?

02:12:41.394 --> 02:12:44.186
My dear wife, it's not me.

02:12:44.445 --> 02:12:48.986
The lover upstairs
will kiss his dear wife.

02:12:49.130 --> 02:12:50.839
All right.

02:12:51.447 --> 02:12:52.864
Hey, daughter!

02:12:52.945 --> 02:12:58.294
What do you say..
He is coming downstairs to kiss you.

02:13:00.988 --> 02:13:02.405
Aunt.
- Yes.

02:13:02.505 --> 02:13:05.630
Tell him not to come down.
I am going home.

02:13:05.788 --> 02:13:08.614
Madhu! Please don't go. I am coming.

02:13:08.695 --> 02:13:11.570
Don't come down! I am leaving.

02:13:11.695 --> 02:13:12.943
I am coming.

02:13:20.884 --> 02:13:22.285
Raja!

02:13:39.455 --> 02:13:42.330
Yes, Doctor. It's an emergency.
Please come immediately.

02:13:42.695 --> 02:13:44.156
Nurse, arrange for the blood.
- Yes, sir.

02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:45.596
Doctor, do the arrangements
for the operation. - Yes, sir.

02:13:45.677 --> 02:13:46.530
Please. Hurry up!

02:13:46.611 --> 02:13:49.986
Please save my Raja!
- We are trying our level best, Madam.

02:13:50.375 --> 02:13:51.708
The patient's condition
is very serious.

02:13:51.861 --> 02:13:54.028
You arrange for at least Rs.1 lakh.

02:13:54.528 --> 02:13:56.070
You don't worry about the money,
Doctor.

02:13:56.184 --> 02:13:58.809
I will bring as much money as possible.
You just arrange for the operation.

02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:22.653
Madam, where are you going?
Sir and grandma have gone out.

02:14:23.028 --> 02:14:24.028
Where have they gone?

02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:26.067
They have gone out of town.
I don't know when they'll return.

02:14:46.972 --> 02:14:50.014
You! For what have you come here?
Go away!

02:14:50.095 --> 02:14:52.563
Listen to me at least.
Raja has met with an accident.

02:14:52.644 --> 02:14:54.560
What? Where is Raja?

02:14:54.695 --> 02:14:56.611
He is breathing his
last in the hospital now.

02:14:57.195 --> 02:15:00.236
We have to get him operated.
I need Rs.1 lakh for that.

02:15:00.403 --> 02:15:02.278
If the operation is not
done as soon as possible..

02:15:02.361 --> 02:15:03.697
..then he may not survive.

02:15:03.963 --> 02:15:06.236
Please save my Raja!
Please save my Raja!

02:15:06.361 --> 02:15:07.861
Please take me to my Raja.

02:15:08.028 --> 02:15:09.155
Fine. You both go to the hospital.

02:15:09.236 --> 02:15:11.313
I will bring the money and come there.
- Let's go!

02:15:25.733 --> 02:15:27.566
Have you gone mad, Hazari Prasad?

02:15:28.047 --> 02:15:29.547
You are being sentimental
about your son..

02:15:29.653 --> 02:15:31.820
..and helping your enemy's daughter.

02:15:32.155 --> 02:15:33.739
Have you forgotten the
day when that scum, Mehra..

02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:35.736
..had slapped you
amongst a huge gathering?

02:15:36.153 --> 02:15:39.570
Hazari Prasad, this is the
right moment to avenge your insult.

02:15:39.695 --> 02:15:41.028
Do not let it slip
off from your hands.

02:15:41.153 --> 02:15:43.028
Do not let it slip off from your hands,
Hazari Prasad.

02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:51.995
Mother, why hasn't father come yet?

02:15:52.630 --> 02:15:53.964
Don't worry, dear.

02:15:54.236 --> 02:15:55.861
He must be on his way with the money.

02:16:01.861 --> 02:16:02.719
Wait!

02:16:06.153 --> 02:16:07.778
You love Raja very much, isn't it?

02:16:10.861 --> 02:16:13.486
Then what can you do for Raja?
- Anything.

02:16:13.861 --> 02:16:15.861
But let Raja get operated first.

02:16:15.986 --> 02:16:18.070
Every second is
very precious for him.

02:16:19.361 --> 02:16:20.778
And Raja is precious for me.

02:16:21.028 --> 02:16:22.153
Then what do you want?

02:16:22.528 --> 02:16:24.230
Your Mangalsutra
(Symbol of marriage).

02:16:28.114 --> 02:16:31.030
What are you saying?
Have you gone mad?

02:16:31.111 --> 02:16:32.903
Mad people do not
speak in their senses.

02:16:33.028 --> 02:16:35.102
Do not instigate a
married woman to curse you.

02:16:35.403 --> 02:16:38.403
A married woman's
curse changes destiny.

02:16:38.736 --> 02:16:42.028
Then whatever happens,
even God cannot change it.

02:16:42.111 --> 02:16:44.945
I don't know what form
her curse would take.

02:16:45.028 --> 02:16:47.070
Stop this rubbish!
Or you'll have to face the consequences.

02:16:47.153 --> 02:16:50.028
You are not a human being.
You are a demon. You are a beast!

02:16:50.109 --> 02:16:51.447
Yes. I am a demon. I am a beast.

02:16:51.599 --> 02:16:54.320
But who turned me into a beast?
This girl's father.

02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:56.360
He has embarrassed me.
He has insulted me.

02:16:56.445 --> 02:16:58.153
He slapped me amongst
a huge gathering.

02:16:58.236 --> 02:17:00.278
But why are you making the
daughter pay for her father's mistake?

02:17:00.403 --> 02:17:01.820
Give the bag to me!

02:17:04.111 --> 02:17:06.236
Do not dare to
interfere in my affairs.

02:17:06.361 --> 02:17:08.486
Get lost from here. Otherwise
our relationship will come to an end.

02:17:08.566 --> 02:17:10.149
Go away from here. Go!
- Listen to me.

02:17:10.236 --> 02:17:11.703
Go away from here!

02:17:13.195 --> 02:17:14.695
Now you listen to me carefully.

02:17:14.778 --> 02:17:16.861
If your husband dies then
don't hold me responsible.

02:17:17.353 --> 02:17:20.437
I plead to you.
For God's sake, please don't do this.

02:17:20.519 --> 02:17:22.166
I am not doing all this for God.
I am doing all this for my sake.

02:17:22.278 --> 02:17:25.778
But if Raja is my husband
he is your son, too.

02:17:25.859 --> 02:17:28.484
My son died the day
he got married to you..

02:17:28.695 --> 02:17:30.570
..and put this Mangalsutra
around your neck.

02:17:30.695 --> 02:17:33.077
My success lies in this necklace.
Give it to me.

02:17:34.607 --> 02:17:36.357
This is not just
an ordinary necklace.

02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:39.570
In each black bead of this
necklace all those nights..

02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:41.361
..of Karva Chauth (Fasting day
for husband's long life) are entwined..

02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:44.528
..when I had prayed for
the well being of my husband.

02:17:44.898 --> 02:17:47.148
If you would have asked me for my life
I would have gladly given it to you.

02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:49.630
But how can I give
my Mangalsutra to you?

02:17:50.153 --> 02:17:52.986
You are wasting your tears and my time,
you foolish girl!

02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:55.236
I am leaving.
- No!

02:17:55.361 --> 02:17:59.195
Please don't do this.
Please do not separate me from Raja.

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:01.153
I cannot live without him.

02:18:01.268 --> 02:18:03.310
I will die.

02:18:03.403 --> 02:18:04.496
Then die!

02:18:05.070 --> 02:18:06.000
Stop!

02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:10.694
I am ready to do whatever you say.

02:18:15.778 --> 02:18:18.361
Come on. Swear by your husband that..

02:18:18.445 --> 02:18:21.070
..after today, there won't be any
relation between him and you. Come on.

02:18:21.903 --> 02:18:23.280
From today onwards,
you will not meet him.

02:18:23.361 --> 02:18:24.724
You will never ever cross his path.

02:18:24.805 --> 02:18:26.840
You'll never tell him
why you stopped meeting him.

02:18:26.921 --> 02:18:28.921
I bind with the oath of the
relationship of a husband and wife.

02:18:29.002 --> 02:18:30.649
From now on you and Raja
are not husband and wife.

02:18:30.745 --> 02:18:34.245
If you break this promise,
you'll see Raja dead. - No.

02:18:34.903 --> 02:18:38.195
I agree. I agree.

02:19:16.111 --> 02:19:23.403
"You should always be alive."

02:19:23.695 --> 02:19:29.736
"I pray only for that."

02:19:30.403 --> 02:19:37.820
"If death comes, let it take me."

02:19:38.181 --> 02:19:43.931
"You should be spared all the pain."

02:19:44.861 --> 02:19:51.945
"I have just done it once.
I have fallen in love with you."

02:19:52.028 --> 02:19:59.945
"I have just done it once.
I have fallen in love with you."

02:20:04.278 --> 02:20:05.138
Dear..

02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:07.703
Doctor. How is my Raja?
Please tell me, Doctor.

02:20:07.784 --> 02:20:09.090
There is no need to worry now.

02:20:09.210 --> 02:20:11.710
He is out of danger.
If you want, you can see him.

02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:13.986
Hey, what happened?
- Hey! He has dashed a girl!

02:21:15.086 --> 02:21:16.121
Oh God!

02:21:17.226 --> 02:21:19.267
Excuse me. Move.

02:21:20.486 --> 02:21:24.572
Oh my God! Madhu! Daughter!

02:21:25.922 --> 02:21:28.361
Guard. Driver, bring some water.
- Sir, water.

02:21:33.250 --> 02:21:34.292
My child!

02:21:36.653 --> 02:21:37.778
Daddy!

02:21:38.486 --> 02:21:40.653
Daddy, I want to die.
- No.

02:21:40.903 --> 02:21:44.486
I want to die. - No, child.
I'll not let you die, my daughter.

02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:47.278
Who has done this to you? Who is he?

02:22:01.070 --> 02:22:03.445
Mr. Mehra!
What is this that I am seeing?

02:22:03.695 --> 02:22:06.611
A rich man's daughter,
in this condition.

02:22:07.044 --> 02:22:09.185
It seems she has
not eaten for many days.

02:22:09.266 --> 02:22:11.570
Whereas Mr. Mehra has four hotels.

02:22:12.155 --> 02:22:13.155
Look at her clothes!

02:22:13.236 --> 02:22:15.153
She doesn't even have proper
clothes to cover herself.

02:22:15.234 --> 02:22:17.859
Mr. Mehra has six mills of cloth.

02:22:18.153 --> 02:22:20.153
Ladies and gentlemen,
maybe you all don't know him..

02:22:20.236 --> 02:22:22.403
..but I know Mr. Mehra very well.

02:22:22.778 --> 02:22:26.153
Seeing all this,
I am unable to believe my eyes.

02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:28.361
The daughter whose
one sob would shake..

02:22:28.486 --> 02:22:30.653
..the very foundation
of Mehra Industries..

02:22:31.153 --> 02:22:32.820
..the same daughter
is like a corpse today.

02:22:32.903 --> 02:22:33.830
Hazari!

02:22:34.111 --> 02:22:36.570
There is no use of shouting,
Mr. Mehra.

02:22:36.737 --> 02:22:39.029
Just have some pity on
your daughter's condition!

02:22:39.361 --> 02:22:45.223
So gentlemen, this helpless girl
fell in love and ran away from home.

02:22:45.986 --> 02:22:50.041
As it always happens,
her lover threw her out of the house.

02:22:50.653 --> 02:22:52.778
Now why did he throw her out?
I don't know anything about that.

02:22:52.861 --> 02:22:54.445
Only Mr. Mehra
can enlighten you on that.

02:22:54.653 --> 02:22:57.236
But I have a request.

02:22:57.871 --> 02:23:00.121
If there is some good marriage
proposal then let him know.

02:23:00.403 --> 02:23:01.653
Do not worry about the money.

02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:04.861
Mr. Mehra has lots of money!
You will get a big dowry.

02:23:04.945 --> 02:23:07.403
We are not so shameless that
we will use the things which others..

02:23:07.486 --> 02:23:08.882
..have used and thrown.

02:23:10.195 --> 02:23:11.653
Did you hear him, Mr. Mehra?

02:23:11.945 --> 02:23:14.153
Now your daughter has
just two options left.

02:23:14.508 --> 02:23:17.341
Either she commits suicide
or she can become a prostitute.

02:23:17.445 --> 02:23:20.438
Shut your mouth, Hazari!
- You shut your mouth, Mehra!

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:27.695
Take my shawl and cover this corpse.

02:23:27.903 --> 02:23:31.611
It is a bit worn out because
it belongs to a scrap vendor.

02:23:31.945 --> 02:23:34.945
But it is sufficient to
cover your daughter's dignity.

02:23:35.528 --> 02:23:40.361
Also take this bowl and start
begging for your daughter's life.

02:23:41.195 --> 02:23:43.528
Remember one thing, Mehra.

02:23:44.653 --> 02:23:49.403
The slap that cannot
be seen hurts more.

02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:53.611
Idiot!

02:23:59.028 --> 02:24:01.063
You beast.

02:24:03.736 --> 02:24:06.153
Take this, child. Have the medicine.

02:24:07.237 --> 02:24:09.526
First tell me, where is Madhu?

02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:13.028
Whenever I ask you,
you always evade the issue.

02:24:14.611 --> 02:24:16.320
Why don't you tell me where is she?

02:24:16.736 --> 02:24:18.611
How is she? She is fine, isn't it?

02:24:18.986 --> 02:24:20.945
However she is, I want to see her.
I want to meet her.

02:24:21.153 --> 02:24:23.736
Where is Madhu, Mother?
- Do you want to know where Madhu is?

02:24:24.283 --> 02:24:25.325
How she is?

02:24:25.570 --> 02:24:26.820
Then listen to me, son.

02:24:27.236 --> 02:24:30.486
The Madhu,
for whom you are in so much pain..

02:24:30.695 --> 02:24:32.945
..has left you and gone
back to her father's house.

02:24:33.153 --> 02:24:35.945
No! You are telling lies!
This is not possible.

02:24:36.028 --> 02:24:39.653
Then why didn't she come to meet
you when you were fighting with death?

02:24:39.751 --> 02:24:41.334
Because she was enjoying
herself at her father's house.

02:24:41.528 --> 02:24:42.986
Thank God we reached there in time.

02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:44.570
Otherwise there was
nobody to take care of you.

02:24:44.653 --> 02:24:47.111
No! My Madhu cannot do this.

02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:48.569
She cannot betray me.

02:24:48.861 --> 02:24:51.653
Daddy, she can die for me,
but she cannot leave me alone to die.

02:24:51.736 --> 02:24:53.945
You foolish boy!
The girl whom you are considering..

02:24:54.028 --> 02:24:55.820
..to be your wife,
your beloved, your lover.

02:24:55.903 --> 02:24:57.445
The girl whom you had married.

02:24:57.556 --> 02:24:59.139
The girl around whose neck
you had put the holy Mangalsutra..

02:24:59.238 --> 02:25:00.280
..she threw it on my face.

02:25:00.361 --> 02:25:02.403
The Mangalsutra which
you had given to her. Look.

02:25:06.662 --> 02:25:08.412
You are telling lies.
You are telling lies.

02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:11.736
If you trust your eyes more than
my word then go and see it for yourself.

02:25:11.827 --> 02:25:14.435
See whether your Madhu
even recognises you. Go and see.

02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:17.345
Madhu!

02:25:25.111 --> 02:25:26.369
Madhu!

02:25:42.405 --> 02:25:44.405
Swear by the pure relationship
of a husband and wife.

02:25:44.486 --> 02:25:46.236
From today onwards,
Raja and you are not husband and wife.

02:25:46.317 --> 02:25:49.484
And if you break this promise
then you will see Raja dead.

02:25:50.861 --> 02:25:51.720
Hi, Madhu!

02:25:53.778 --> 02:25:55.111
I have brought flowers for you.

02:26:01.611 --> 02:26:04.653
Come, Shakti!
- You are looking gorgeous.

02:26:06.028 --> 02:26:08.851
You are so nice.
You care so much for me.

02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:25.863
Come, Shakti.
- Yes, come on.

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:30.611
Raja, you!

02:26:31.195 --> 02:26:32.211
Why?

02:26:33.381 --> 02:26:35.339
Are you upset to see me alive?

02:26:39.611 --> 02:26:44.153
Madhu, I never thought
that you would stoop so low.

02:26:46.361 --> 02:26:47.861
When my father told me that..

02:26:48.611 --> 02:26:52.028
..you left me alone in the
hospital in critical condition..

02:26:53.028 --> 02:26:55.111
..I did not believe him.

02:26:56.643 --> 02:27:00.768
But now I have realised
that my father was right..

02:27:01.945 --> 02:27:03.916
..and my love was false.

02:27:08.028 --> 02:27:09.278
Why are you quiet, Madhu?

02:27:10.404 --> 02:27:11.319
Answer me.

02:27:13.364 --> 02:27:14.572
Say something, Madhu.

02:27:14.653 --> 02:27:16.361
What was lacking in my love?

02:27:17.445 --> 02:27:19.236
Madhu, what wrong had I done that..

02:27:19.445 --> 02:27:21.320
..you punished me so badly?

02:27:22.486 --> 02:27:25.903
Look Raja, I have been used
to a luxurious life since my childhood.

02:27:26.653 --> 02:27:29.437
By staying with you,
my requirements couldn't be fulfilled.

02:27:32.138 --> 02:27:35.680
Moreover, after your accident,
neither did I want to live as a widow..

02:27:36.111 --> 02:27:38.528
..nor did I want to
live as a cripple's wife.

02:27:41.945 --> 02:27:44.275
No. No, Shakti.

02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:48.111
Let him go.

02:27:48.903 --> 02:27:50.611
This poor fellow is
not in his senses right now.

02:27:50.695 --> 02:27:52.486
In fact,
I have come to my senses now.

02:27:53.903 --> 02:27:57.820
I have loved you, Madhu.
I will always love you.

02:27:58.736 --> 02:28:02.695
But whatever you did to me,
please don't tell it to anybody.

02:28:03.611 --> 02:28:05.861
Otherwise people
will lose faith in love.

02:28:59.153 --> 02:29:02.957
Raja! I love you!

02:29:03.953 --> 02:29:07.072
I love you!

02:29:07.153 --> 02:29:10.403
I love you!

02:29:10.486 --> 02:29:13.403
I love you!

02:29:13.615 --> 02:29:17.143
I love you!

02:29:38.778 --> 02:29:43.986
"Oh my beloved!"

02:29:45.751 --> 02:29:52.084
"Why did you forget me?"

02:29:53.403 --> 02:29:59.945
"Disloyal or cruel."

02:30:00.461 --> 02:30:04.878
"What do I call you, my darling?"

02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:08.776
"You have broken my heart."

02:30:08.857 --> 02:30:11.780
"What wrong have I done?
Please let me know."

02:30:11.861 --> 02:30:18.236
"Oh my beloved!
I am your darling lover."

02:30:18.403 --> 02:30:21.528
"I have tolerated all my tears."

02:30:21.653 --> 02:30:24.528
"I have survived through
lots of difficulties."

02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:30.628
"What is my helplessness?
How do I tell you about that?"

02:30:30.709 --> 02:30:33.667
"Oh my beloved!"

02:30:33.785 --> 02:30:38.035
"Why did you forget me?"

02:31:19.195 --> 02:31:25.570
"If I had known that
you are a disloyal woman."

02:31:25.695 --> 02:31:32.820
"Then I would never have
fallen in love with you."

02:31:35.016 --> 02:31:41.239
"If I had known that
you are a disloyal woman."

02:31:41.391 --> 02:31:47.391
"Then I would never have
fallen in love with you."

02:31:47.573 --> 02:31:53.698
"Trust me.
Do not blame me like this."

02:31:53.861 --> 02:31:59.903
"Punish me if you want. But
please do not call me a disloyal woman."

02:32:00.111 --> 02:32:06.153
"My beloved! You have betrayed me."

02:32:06.310 --> 02:32:12.018
"But my loyalty will
never be able to forget you."

02:32:12.111 --> 02:32:18.736
"Oh my beloved!
I am your darling lover."

02:32:18.817 --> 02:32:21.708
"I have tolerated all my tears."

02:32:21.834 --> 02:32:24.876
"I have survived through
lots of difficulties."

02:32:25.028 --> 02:32:30.695
"What is my helplessness?
How do I tell you about that?"

02:32:30.813 --> 02:32:33.813
"Oh my beloved!"

02:32:33.945 --> 02:32:39.278
"Why did you forget me?"

02:33:31.544 --> 02:33:37.929
"I feel like ruining myself."

02:33:38.010 --> 02:33:45.176
"I feel like embracing death."

02:33:47.153 --> 02:33:53.153
"I feel like ruining myself."

02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:59.364
"I feel like embracing death."

02:33:59.445 --> 02:34:05.570
"Come and look into my
heart by tearing it apart."

02:34:05.739 --> 02:34:11.822
"You will find the colours
of your pictures in it."

02:34:11.903 --> 02:34:17.903
"Oh my darling.
You may live peacefully."

02:34:18.028 --> 02:34:23.611
"This is the wish
of my broken heart."

02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:30.320
"Oh my beloved!
I am your darling lover."

02:34:30.445 --> 02:34:33.611
"I have tolerated all my tears."

02:34:33.692 --> 02:34:36.192
"I have survived through
lots of difficulties."

02:34:36.611 --> 02:34:42.392
"What is my helplessness?
How do I tell you about that?"

02:34:42.473 --> 02:34:45.098
"Oh my beloved!"

02:34:45.359 --> 02:34:48.275
"Oh my beloved!"

02:34:48.478 --> 02:34:51.478
"Oh my beloved!"

02:34:51.559 --> 02:34:55.600
"Oh my beloved!"

02:34:57.028 --> 02:35:00.195
Raja, look at
your pathetic condition.

02:35:00.403 --> 02:35:03.195
Why are you ruining yourself
for that disloyal woman?

02:35:03.557 --> 02:35:04.641
Leave me alone, Daddy.

02:35:04.778 --> 02:35:07.111
How do I leave you alone?
I am your father after all.

02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:08.564
Come with me.

02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:10.861
We will teach such a lesson
to that girl and her father..

02:35:10.945 --> 02:35:12.486
..that they will remember
it throughout their lives.

02:35:12.736 --> 02:35:14.278
I will get you married
very pompously.

02:35:14.403 --> 02:35:16.739
Your wedding procession will pass
from the front of that girl's house.

02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:17.952
You'll see.

02:35:18.695 --> 02:35:21.878
Whether it is my funeral
or wedding procession..

02:35:22.776 --> 02:35:24.193
..doesn't make any difference to me.

02:35:25.278 --> 02:35:26.986
You are free to do whatever you want.

02:35:32.903 --> 02:35:35.070
Look, read it yourself.

02:35:35.736 --> 02:35:39.070
The person for whom you
cry day and night, your Raja..

02:35:39.361 --> 02:35:40.778
..is going to get married once again.

02:35:46.486 --> 02:35:47.986
Shakti! What happened?

02:35:51.153 --> 02:35:52.633
He has shown his true colours.

02:35:58.986 --> 02:36:00.003
Madhu..

02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:05.570
..for how long will
you live this way?

02:36:06.611 --> 02:36:09.195
I am unable to bear
this condition of yours.

02:36:09.914 --> 02:36:12.164
Child, your entire
life is ahead of you.

02:36:12.927 --> 02:36:14.386
Forget whatever has happened.

02:36:16.153 --> 02:36:17.581
Start life afresh.

02:36:19.653 --> 02:36:21.070
Get married to Shakti.

02:36:21.528 --> 02:36:22.736
No, Daddy.

02:36:23.361 --> 02:36:25.653
Never ever say it again.

02:36:26.486 --> 02:36:28.195
Leave me to my condition.

02:36:28.987 --> 02:36:29.814
Dear!

02:36:31.778 --> 02:36:34.028
How can I leave you in this state?

02:36:34.236 --> 02:36:35.736
I'm your father.

02:36:35.861 --> 02:36:37.653
I want your happiness.

02:36:39.153 --> 02:36:40.903
You want to see me happy, right?

02:36:41.028 --> 02:36:41.878
Yes.

02:36:42.945 --> 02:36:45.820
Then please take
me away from this place.

02:36:49.736 --> 02:36:55.236
Yes, dear. I'll take you.

02:36:56.462 --> 02:36:57.587
I'll take you far away.

02:36:58.028 --> 02:36:59.101
The auspicious time of
the engagement is passing by.

02:36:59.182 --> 02:37:00.611
Your son hasn't come until now.

02:37:00.854 --> 02:37:02.396
Raja might be on his way.

02:37:02.528 --> 02:37:05.236
But you have done all
the arrangements, isn't it?

02:37:05.486 --> 02:37:07.820
You need not worry at all,
Hazari Prasad.

02:37:08.195 --> 02:37:09.653
I have done all the arrangements.

02:37:09.810 --> 02:37:11.477
I remember my promise very well.

02:37:11.695 --> 02:37:12.535
Radhe Shyam!

02:37:24.695 --> 02:37:25.861
Thank you. Thank you.

02:37:26.111 --> 02:37:27.695
This is nothing at all,
Hazari Prasad.

02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:30.320
These are the gifts for the groom.
It is not the actual dowry.

02:37:30.613 --> 02:37:32.197
Let the marriage take place once.

02:37:32.278 --> 02:37:33.861
You will see that
you will not find place in...

02:37:33.945 --> 02:37:34.820
...your house to keep
all these things.

02:37:34.903 --> 02:37:36.403
For now I'll go and
find a place to keep this.

02:37:36.528 --> 02:37:38.153
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.

02:37:38.278 --> 02:37:42.111
I will keep so much money with me.
Oh my Goddess!

02:37:42.195 --> 02:37:43.290
Oh my Goddess!
- Listen,

02:37:44.027 --> 02:37:45.908
what are you doing for money?

02:37:46.236 --> 02:37:48.611
You are getting my
Raja married to a mad girl.

02:37:48.695 --> 02:37:50.778
All the girls are basically mad.
Look at yourself.

02:37:50.945 --> 02:37:53.028
If you were not mad then would
you say such unfortunate things..

02:37:53.111 --> 02:37:54.445
..on the occasion
of your son's engagement?

02:37:54.528 --> 02:37:57.403
Do you know what my son
is going through right now?

02:37:57.695 --> 02:38:00.153
He is heart broken.

02:38:00.695 --> 02:38:02.236
He has started drinking liquor.

02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:05.736
Do you know, he has not
come back home since last night.

02:38:05.945 --> 02:38:07.403
But you are not at
all bothered about him.

02:38:07.861 --> 02:38:09.486
Have mercy on your child!

02:38:09.695 --> 02:38:12.153
Don't be so cruel to him!
- Stop your rubbish!

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.861
I know what I am doing. Okay?

02:38:18.111 --> 02:38:21.153
Last time when I wanted
to sell this coat, Mr. Pasricha.

02:38:21.570 --> 02:38:23.153
I thought that..

02:38:23.234 --> 02:38:24.984
Who is Mr.
Hazari Prasad amongst you all?

02:38:26.445 --> 02:38:28.236
It's me. What is the matter?

02:38:28.422 --> 02:38:30.047
Is this the photograph of your son?

02:38:30.653 --> 02:38:32.445
Yes. This is my son
Raja's photograph.

02:38:33.070 --> 02:38:34.153
What's the matter, Inspector?

02:38:34.236 --> 02:38:36.028
What has happened to him?
Is he all right?

02:38:36.153 --> 02:38:37.445
Your son has met with an accident.

02:38:37.570 --> 02:38:40.070
We have recovered all these
things from his dead body. - No!

02:38:40.198 --> 02:38:41.739
This is a lie! A lie!

02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:44.944
Then you confirm it yourself.
Constable, bring the body inside.

02:39:06.403 --> 02:39:07.789
No!

02:39:09.839 --> 02:39:11.214
My Raja!

02:39:13.278 --> 02:39:14.570
Raja!

02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:17.528
My son Raja!

02:39:25.111 --> 02:39:28.153
Now be assured! Be assured!

02:39:28.545 --> 02:39:30.629
You killer! You sinner!

02:39:31.233 --> 02:39:33.441
You have killed my son.

02:39:34.195 --> 02:39:37.073
You have separated Raja and Madhu.

02:39:37.154 --> 02:39:39.987
You have ruined all their happiness.

02:39:40.653 --> 02:39:46.486
When my son was fighting against
life and death in the hospital..

02:39:46.602 --> 02:39:49.518
..then instead of
saving you son's life..

02:39:49.778 --> 02:39:53.945
..you made a deal with
Madhu regarding her husband.

02:39:54.153 --> 02:39:56.051
You took away her husband from her.

02:39:56.132 --> 02:40:01.840
This is her curse which has
separated my son from me today.

02:40:02.639 --> 02:40:07.472
Now sell this corpse
also in the market.

02:40:07.695 --> 02:40:10.736
Maybe you will get
some money with that also.

02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:16.096
You have killed him.
Now sell him off. Sell him of.

02:40:17.865 --> 02:40:18.865
My son!

02:40:19.107 --> 02:40:20.055
Mother!

02:40:27.945 --> 02:40:31.115
My son, Raja! Raja!

02:40:31.195 --> 02:40:34.822
You are alive, my son?

02:40:34.903 --> 02:40:36.111
Yes, Mother.

02:40:37.653 --> 02:40:40.236
My Raja is alive.

02:40:41.418 --> 02:40:43.792
My son is alive.

02:40:46.656 --> 02:40:47.778
He is alive.

02:40:48.192 --> 02:40:51.150
Mr. Raja, how did your
clothes come on this corpse?

02:40:53.923 --> 02:40:55.881
I had drunk and I was
lying unconscious.

02:40:57.516 --> 02:41:00.557
At that time, he must have
stolen my coat and my chain.

02:41:00.903 --> 02:41:03.070
Then he must have
met with an accident.

02:41:05.611 --> 02:41:06.945
I wish that I had
died instead of him.

02:41:07.026 --> 02:41:09.484
No, Son. You should never say that.
- Don't touch me!

02:41:10.278 --> 02:41:13.028
But, son.. - Dare if you will call
me a son. Or even if you will touch me.

02:41:13.165 --> 02:41:16.332
But son, I have done all this for you.
- Not for me, Mr. Hazari Prasad.

02:41:17.445 --> 02:41:20.861
What am I to you?
Just a saleable thing.

02:41:22.361 --> 02:41:24.903
Besides selling me,
what else can you do?

02:41:26.653 --> 02:41:28.778
Maybe you had given birth
to me for this reason only.

02:41:30.203 --> 02:41:33.828
As a butcher nurtures
and nourishes a goat.

02:41:34.653 --> 02:41:36.611
Then he sells off every piece of his.

02:41:38.278 --> 02:41:40.570
No, Raja.
No! You are under a misunderstanding.

02:41:40.695 --> 02:41:42.073
You are telling lies.

02:41:44.236 --> 02:41:45.695
I have heard everything.

02:41:45.986 --> 02:41:48.528
I heard what you did with Madhu.
What sacrifice you asked her to make?

02:41:50.278 --> 02:41:51.861
Madhu was a stranger.

02:41:53.153 --> 02:41:56.570
But still for the sake of
my life she sacrificed her husband.

02:41:58.675 --> 02:42:02.508
But you. I was your very own blood.

02:42:03.653 --> 02:42:05.028
A part of you.

02:42:06.695 --> 02:42:09.653
Sometimes a hungry lion eats
his own children out of helplessness.

02:42:10.347 --> 02:42:12.972
But what was your helplessness, Mr.
Hazari Prasad?

02:42:13.512 --> 02:42:15.947
What were you hungry for?
How much hungry were you that..

02:42:16.028 --> 02:42:17.445
...didn't get satisfied even
after eating your own child?

02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:19.008
Stop it, child! Stop it!

02:42:19.528 --> 02:42:21.986
What are you crying for, Mr.
Hazari Prasad?

02:42:22.736 --> 02:42:26.195
You had said a few days
ago that you don't have any son.

02:42:26.843 --> 02:42:28.301
That I am not your son.

02:42:28.865 --> 02:42:31.365
Today I admit this in
front of all these people..

02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:35.278
..that after today,
you are not my father.

02:42:44.153 --> 02:42:47.486
Raja!
- Raja, my son, where are you going?

02:42:49.028 --> 02:42:51.570
I am going away from this
suffocation and embarrassment.

02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:53.653
I am going back to my Madhu.

02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:02.736
Take care of the house.
- Yes, Mother.

02:43:40.403 --> 02:43:42.861
Where are you going?
There's no one inside. - What?

02:43:43.278 --> 02:43:44.820
Where did everybody go?
- To the airport.

02:43:44.945 --> 02:43:48.153
Everyone is going to London
forever by the 4 o'clock flight.

02:44:43.861 --> 02:44:45.861
Hello. Haji Ali traffic control.

02:44:45.945 --> 02:44:48.111
A boy riding a red bike has
jumped the signal and is running away.

02:44:48.195 --> 02:44:49.653
Get hold of him immediately. Over!

02:44:49.778 --> 02:44:51.145
Received the message. Over and out!

02:45:14.195 --> 02:45:15.436
Are you riding the bike
under the influence of alcohol?

02:45:15.570 --> 02:45:16.695
Sir, I am really in
a hurry right now.

02:45:16.778 --> 02:45:17.858
I have to reach
the airport immediately.

02:45:18.028 --> 02:45:19.153
Show me the licence.

02:45:20.403 --> 02:45:21.695
Sir, the licence is at home.

02:45:21.903 --> 02:45:23.183
You must have papers
for the bike at least.

02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:25.486
Sir, please let me go.
I am in a real hurry.

02:45:25.861 --> 02:45:27.736
Have you stolen this bike?
- No, sir.

02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:29.611
Sir, I think that there is
something fishy here. - No, sir.

02:45:29.695 --> 02:45:31.736
Fine. Arrest him.
- Sir, please try to understand.

02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:33.611
Sir, trust me. Right now it
is the question of my life and death.

02:45:33.692 --> 02:45:35.892
I said, shut up. Come with me. Come.

02:45:37.278 --> 02:45:40.236
What is this nonsense?
Why did you catch his hand?

02:45:40.486 --> 02:45:42.486
Don't you know that I am with him?

02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:45.073
Why are you tormenting
my friend who is also a lover?

02:45:45.153 --> 02:45:47.611
Sir, please help me, sir.
If I don't reach the airport on time..

02:45:47.736 --> 02:45:49.316
..then my Madhu will
be separated from me forever.

02:45:49.445 --> 02:45:50.820
What are you saying?
- Yes. - Sir.

02:45:51.195 --> 02:45:52.820
He was breaking all the traffic
rules and running away. - No, sir.

02:45:52.945 --> 02:45:53.986
I guess, it is a matter of theft.

02:45:54.111 --> 02:45:56.153
Hey! It is not a matter of theft.

02:45:56.236 --> 02:45:57.570
It is a matter of a love affair.

02:45:57.767 --> 02:46:01.405
Hey! When the public
is crazy in love..

02:46:01.486 --> 02:46:03.820
..then our law will
not be able to do anything.

02:46:04.278 --> 02:46:06.419
I got it, sir.
- You got it, right?

02:46:06.570 --> 02:46:08.886
Now no plane will take
off from the airport until.

02:46:09.044 --> 02:46:11.544
I do not drop you at the airport.

02:46:11.861 --> 02:46:13.476
I will drop you there. Come on.
- Thank you, sir.

02:47:02.903 --> 02:47:07.320
Air India AI 111 is
ready to take off to London.

02:47:07.445 --> 02:47:11.820
The passengers are requested
to proceed to gate number 10.

02:47:54.111 --> 02:47:55.111
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

02:47:55.278 --> 02:47:56.528
The Air India flight,
which was supposed to fly to London.

02:47:56.611 --> 02:47:57.788
Sorry, sir.
The flight has already taken off.

02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:34.734
Please forgive me, son.

02:48:53.653 --> 02:48:56.403
Take this and put it around her neck.

02:49:24.361 --> 02:49:25.607
Just a minute. Just a minute.

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.980
At least allow Dev
Anand to click a picture.

02:49:28.195 --> 02:49:31.403
Just a minute. Just a minute.
- Even you can join in, sir.

02:49:36.486 --> 02:49:37.957
I thought that..

02:49:39.528 --> 02:49:42.070
Brothers look, he the same
person who had given us fake money.

02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:44.405
I will hit him badly. Come on.

02:49:44.486 --> 02:49:46.694
Let's go. Come on. Get hold of him.

02:49:46.775 --> 02:49:48.442
You had distributed
fake currency amongst us.

02:49:48.695 --> 02:49:49.778
We will not spare you.

02:49:49.861 --> 02:49:51.278
Hey! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

02:49:51.361 --> 02:49:52.903
This Hazari Prasad has changed now.

02:49:53.028 --> 02:49:54.278
This is not the old
Hazari Prasad now.

02:49:54.361 --> 02:49:56.278
Now look,
I will give you these notes.

02:49:56.359 --> 02:49:58.651
But daddy, these are fake ones.
- Hey! What are you saying?

02:49:58.778 --> 02:50:00.903
Fake and real..
Never mind! Never mind!

02:50:01.017 --> 02:50:02.447
But these are the real ones.

02:50:02.528 --> 02:50:06.111
"No one can match up to you."

02:50:07.312 --> 02:50:10.208
"I can't sleep. I have no solace."

02:50:10.289 --> 02:50:12.623
"Somebody,
please go and search for me."

02:50:12.715 --> 02:50:15.631
"I don't know where
my heart is lost."

02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:18.758
"I don't know where
my heart is lost."
