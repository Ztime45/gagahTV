00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:06.137
Today our prime minister
has again told the public that...

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.685
...no citizen in the
country will sleep hungry.

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:10.681
And everyone will
have a house to live in.

00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:13.553
With this we conclude
today's headlines.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:16.537
And now some spicy news.

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:21.057
Famous lover,
Dev Karan Singh whose name...

00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:24.697
...is linked with famous
people like Sushmita Rai...

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:28.057
...Madhuri Tandon,
Urmila Kapoor, etc...

00:03:28.137 --> 00:03:31.174
...has decided to get married.

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:34.737
And the girl is
Pratap Rai Singhania's...

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:37.855
...only daughter. He is one
of our biggest industrialists.

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:40.937
And we are proud to have
Mr. Singhania...

00:03:41.017 --> 00:03:43.297
...in our studio today.

00:03:43.468 --> 00:03:46.097
Let's hear it from our horse's mouth.

00:03:46.745 --> 00:03:50.697
Mr. Singhania, is it really
true that your daughter is to marry...

00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:52.657
...Mr. Dev Karan Singh?

00:03:53.697 --> 00:03:56.432
Mr. Singhania,
are you aware of his antics.

00:03:56.512 --> 00:03:58.103
It's a thing of the past.

00:03:58.183 --> 00:03:59.743
Today, Dev has changed because...

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.460
..he is going to become
my son-in-law. Mine.

00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:06.645
As we speak, he is finalising
a very big international deal.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.268
Where?
- Singapore.

00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:18.351
Beauty is like the moon,
and youth like a lotus.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.111
Seeing you I will
recite a nice sonnet.

00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:26.671
Oh, this fair body
is sculpted out of marble.

00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:29.591
People who see you will think that
they are looking at the Taj Mahal.

00:06:08.296 --> 00:06:12.936
"Your hair is like a black snake."

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:19.136
"You give brightness to the sea,
sun and pearls."

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:24.776
"Your hair is like a black snake."

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:30.176
"You give brightness to the sea,
sun and pearls."

00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:35.536
"Seeing you my heart says..."

00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:40.256
"...that you're slowly
gaining a place in my heart."

00:06:40.336 --> 00:06:45.096
"Your black hair
is like a black snake."

00:06:45.976 --> 00:06:51.256
"You give brightness to the sea,
sun and pearls."

00:07:12.336 --> 00:07:17.216
"Your cheeks are fair.
Lips are juicy."

00:07:18.056 --> 00:07:22.736
"Your walk is intoxicating.
You could mesmerise anyone."

00:07:23.734 --> 00:07:28.376
"My beauty is spicy
and my colour is the best."

00:07:29.473 --> 00:07:34.216
"Any lover will fall
in love with my beauty."

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:39.296
"Seeing you my heart says..."

00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:44.056
"...that you're slowly
gaining a place in my heart."

00:07:44.136 --> 00:07:49.056
"My hair is like a black snake."

00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:54.976
"I give brightness to the sea,
sun and pearls."

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:59.896
"Seeing you my heart says..."

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:04.609
"...that you're slowly
gaining a place in my heart."

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:09.729
"Your hair is like a black snake."

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:15.169
"You give brightness to the sea,
sun and pearls."

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.479
Friends, today at the end...

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.866
...of Asian cultural
fest held in Singapore...

00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:01.414
...I request Mr. Wong
to announce the winner's name.

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:05.089
Mr. Wong, please announce
the name of the winner.

00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:09.973
And the winner is
Miss Priya Verma from India.

00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:20.071
Thank you.

00:09:21.798 --> 00:09:25.358
With this award,
you have won a free ticket.

00:09:25.438 --> 00:09:31.238
You can fly from Singapore to Bombay,
courtesy our sponsors Sun Cruise.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.229
We hope that this journey will be...

00:09:35.348 --> 00:09:38.118
...the most memorable
journey of your life.

00:09:38.584 --> 00:09:41.078
Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:56.919
Welcome.
- Hi.

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:59.839
Welcome. Miss Priya Verma.
I welcome you to Sun Cruise.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.719
Thank you very much.
- Welcome aboard.

00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:05.959
Ouch!

00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:15.131
In my whole life,
I have not been beaten like this.

00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:18.411
Looking at you I felt...

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.331
...as though you are the string that
holds my underwear together.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:21.851
And I'm the underwear.

00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:22.771
Shut up!

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:24.406
You are strange and odd person.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.080
You are reciting a sonnet
instead of saying sorry.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.720
You have killed a tiger just now, dear.
Tell me.

00:10:30.227 --> 00:10:33.027
When you will become the
queen of this parrot's nest.

00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:35.587
Don't touch me,
you multicoloured monkey.

00:10:35.884 --> 00:10:36.667
Come with me.

00:10:36.747 --> 00:10:37.804
Yes, ma'am.
- Idiot!

00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:41.231
What happened, my son, Popatlal?
What happened?

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.027
Congratulations, Popat's mother.
Congratulations.

00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:44.707
Why? - You have found
your daughter-in-law.

00:10:44.787 --> 00:10:46.787
And I have found
the queen of my dreams.

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:48.987
Start the marriage
preparations, mother.

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.048
Today I am very happy.

00:10:51.347 --> 00:10:53.657
Popatlal, today I'm very happy.

00:10:58.934 --> 00:11:01.014
Dev, my father, my grandfather.

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:04.374
May I ask you
why you are spending ten days...

00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:06.934
...on ship when it takes
half an hour by plane?

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.334
My wish.

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:09.907
Dev. Dev.

00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:12.625
Now your days of being
obstinate are gone.

00:11:12.824 --> 00:11:14.294
Along with house and cars...

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:16.737
...the clothes you
are wearing are pawned.

00:11:16.987 --> 00:11:19.705
Your bank balance is zero
and you are covered in debts.

00:11:19.785 --> 00:11:20.574
Hi.

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:22.272
Hi.
- Bye.

00:11:22.562 --> 00:11:23.681
Dev, correct yourself.

00:11:23.921 --> 00:11:25.441
Stop all these pranks.

00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:27.521
Quietly marry Singhania's daughter.

00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:28.761
You will be rich.

00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:30.521
I am talking to you.
Why are you staring there?

00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.281
Stop all these pranks. Please.

00:11:32.361 --> 00:11:35.401
Otherwise our creditors
will eat us alive.

00:11:35.681 --> 00:11:37.001
Leave this ship.

00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:38.961
Catch a plane and
go straight to Mumbai.

00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:41.001
People are waiting
for you there. Please.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.361
Friend Nattu, when did I say that
I won't marry Singhania's daughter?

00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:45.096
Thank you.

00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:48.281
But I have to take Grandma's blessings
before getting married.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.979
And no plane goes to
the island where Granny lives.

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:52.961
I can only get there by ship.
- I know.

00:11:53.081 --> 00:11:54.921
But father and daughter
will be waiting at the airport...

00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:56.721
...with garlands in their hands.

00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.261
There is a party at night.
What do you want me to say to them.

00:11:59.341 --> 00:12:01.124
Tell them that...
- Hi, Dev.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.921
Oh, hi.

00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:06.921
How are you my darling?
- I'm fine.

00:12:07.645 --> 00:12:09.712
Dev, you have forgotten me.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:12.881
How can I forget you,
my mind blowing Meena.

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:15.321
My name is not Meena. It's Deepa.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.756
Oh, yes, Deepa. Deepa. Deepa Sharma.

00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:21.203
It's not Deepa Sharma.
It's Deepa Mehta.

00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:25.441
It doesn't matter if it's Sharma
or Mehta. You are fire, baby.

00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:27.161
You are fire.

00:12:27.766 --> 00:12:29.681
And right now I feel like being burnt.

00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:31.841
Come on, burn me.

00:12:36.825 --> 00:12:38.545
No, no, no.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.985
No, no, no.

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:47.025
I have kept the luggage, ma'am.

00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:48.745
Good day.
- Thank you very much.

00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:50.745
It is so hot.

00:12:57.488 --> 00:13:00.721
Hi, I am Miss Lovelina.

00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:03.704
I will come for dinner
and go at breakfast.

00:13:03.827 --> 00:13:06.786
And if you insist
I will even stay back for lunch.

00:13:06.983 --> 00:13:09.743
Let's drink our evening tea together.
We will have a good time.

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:12.761
Shut up, you old man.
I am not talking to you.

00:13:12.983 --> 00:13:14.983
Dev, tell me, please.

00:13:15.063 --> 00:13:18.582
Look actually I am fasting today.

00:13:18.704 --> 00:13:22.063
That's I why I cannot eat
or drink anything, sister Lovelina.

00:13:22.204 --> 00:13:24.103
Sister! How mean.

00:13:24.183 --> 00:13:26.180
So we're on for tea.

00:13:26.383 --> 00:13:27.343
Shut up!

00:13:27.423 --> 00:13:28.718
You old man.

00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:32.777
Good. Very good.

00:13:32.897 --> 00:13:34.861
Where shall I keep the luggage, sir?
- Keep them here.

00:13:34.941 --> 00:13:36.663
Yes, sir.
- What is your name?

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.216
Rupesh Ghayal.

00:13:39.183 --> 00:13:40.663
Mr. Ghayal, take this.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.183
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

00:13:46.263 --> 00:13:48.100
I am dead.

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:54.582
It seems a that a prey is close.

00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:13.346
Wow.

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:18.929
Good morning, madam.

00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:22.009
I didn't know that first-class passengers
are also given these luxuries.

00:14:22.249 --> 00:14:23.729
By the way,
my name is Dev Karan Singh.

00:14:23.849 --> 00:14:25.449
But you can affectionately
call me Dev.

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:26.815
It doesn't matter if
you are Dev or Mahadev.

00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:28.449
What are you doing in my cabin?
Get out.

00:14:28.529 --> 00:14:30.426
Get out from my cabin right now.
- One minute.

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:33.473
Did anyone ever tell you
that your eyes are very beautiful?

00:14:39.707 --> 00:14:41.147
Hello. Hello, security.

00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:42.467
Come here quickly.

00:14:42.547 --> 00:14:44.947
A rogue has entered my room.
Immediately.

00:14:47.522 --> 00:14:48.962
What are you doing?

00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:50.082
Don't come forward.

00:14:50.162 --> 00:14:51.709
Don't come forward,
otherwise I will scream.

00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:53.521
Wear this jacket, madam.

00:14:53.896 --> 00:14:56.482
If your towel falls down
in front of the security guards...

00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:58.234
...those poor men
will forget their duty.

00:14:58.908 --> 00:15:02.268
And swear on God,
I will be very happy.

00:15:02.348 --> 00:15:03.388
You!

00:15:04.996 --> 00:15:06.356
Come right in.

00:15:09.192 --> 00:15:10.512
Where is the rogue?
Where is the thief?

00:15:10.593 --> 00:15:12.193
Where is he? Tell me.

00:15:12.984 --> 00:15:15.064
A thief wrapped in sheets.

00:15:15.192 --> 00:15:16.792
Madam, come on, get out.

00:15:16.872 --> 00:15:18.992
Idiot, throw him out.
This is my cabin.

00:15:19.073 --> 00:15:20.753
Oh, no. This is my cabin.

00:15:20.942 --> 00:15:22.302
This is my cabin.
- One minute.

00:15:22.382 --> 00:15:24.982
I will decide whose cabin it is, okay.

00:15:25.063 --> 00:15:25.988
Ticket, please.

00:15:29.182 --> 00:15:30.302
Here.

00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:33.651
Who is Dev Karan Singh
among the two of you?

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:37.098
It's me.
- Then this is your cabin.

00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:40.134
Madam, keep the sheet.
Take your luggage.

00:15:40.214 --> 00:15:42.621
Go to your cabin.

00:15:42.702 --> 00:15:47.262
Your cabin,
21B, is on the second floor.

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:48.355
Oh!

00:15:51.442 --> 00:15:53.522
I am sorry.
- The address is wrong.

00:15:53.683 --> 00:15:55.883
Apologise to him. Got it?

00:15:56.762 --> 00:15:59.402
Hey, look, mister,
I.. I made a mistake.

00:15:59.482 --> 00:16:01.122
No, there is no need for that.

00:16:01.202 --> 00:16:03.682
By the way, if you want
you can live in this cabin.

00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:05.202
Oh, really?

00:16:05.402 --> 00:16:07.042
Thank you very much.
- No, no, not at all.

00:16:07.122 --> 00:16:08.202
It's my pleasure.

00:16:08.339 --> 00:16:11.619
You sleep there on the bed
and I will make do here on the sofa.

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:12.777
What?

00:16:13.082 --> 00:16:15.162
What do you mean? I will be on
the bed and you on the sofa.

00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:18.083
We can both be on the sofa.
- Don't touch me.

00:16:18.202 --> 00:16:19.242
You rascal!

00:16:21.322 --> 00:16:25.562
Darling, at least tell
me your name before going.

00:16:25.746 --> 00:16:27.266
What did he think about yourself?

00:16:29.942 --> 00:16:33.022
Come on, the matter is settled.

00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:35.340
Dev has achieved his goal.

00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:41.137
Look the girl is so beautiful.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:05.694
Hey, daughter-in-law.
Recognise me.

00:17:05.887 --> 00:17:07.567
I am Popat's mother.

00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:09.268
Will you have a drink?

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.339
First, I am not your daughter-in-law.

00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:14.501
And secondly,
I don't drink alcohol. Fatso!

00:17:22.364 --> 00:17:23.884
Good morning.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.051
And what a good morning.

00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:47.678
Hey, mister, how did this lift stop?

00:17:47.798 --> 00:17:48.691
Uncle Murlidhar.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:51.218
Uncle Murlidhar?
The lieutenant of this ship.

00:17:51.506 --> 00:17:54.266
Not just this ship,
but the lieutenant of this entire world.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:57.529
The entire world revolves
on my directions.

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.129
And Murlidhar Kishen
Kanhaiya (Lord Krishna)...

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.120
...is bringing us
close again and again...

00:18:03.342 --> 00:18:05.382
...so that we can know each other.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.098
Not just that,
we should merge ourselves together.

00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:09.632
Don't touch me.

00:18:09.744 --> 00:18:12.183
I recognise you very well.

00:18:12.264 --> 00:18:14.184
You are a professional cheat...

00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:16.418
...who traps a rich
girl like Anita Singhania.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:20.517
You are the cheater who says
something and thinks something.

00:18:21.637 --> 00:18:23.157
What is in your eyes?

00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:25.655
Oh!

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.281
This is the intoxication
of love, Priya.

00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:29.161
No.

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.201
And now this intoxication
will go to your head from your eyes.

00:18:32.441 --> 00:18:35.961
It will mingle with
your blood from your brains.

00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:39.871
And it will spread through
the entire body through your blood.

00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:42.329
It will entire your every part.

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:46.078
Agree Priya.
Agree to what your heart says.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.662
Lose yourself in this intoxication.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.450
Lose yourself in this intoxication.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.530
Lose yourself, Priya.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.130
Lose yourself in this intoxication.

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:54.799
Lose yourself, Priya.

00:18:54.987 --> 00:18:56.587
Lose yourself, Priya.

00:18:58.592 --> 00:19:01.712
I feel like killing you
and getting hanged for it.

00:19:02.112 --> 00:19:04.032
You big brute.

00:19:07.552 --> 00:19:09.112
What are you doing?

00:19:41.678 --> 00:19:42.678
Hi.
- Hi.

00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:47.747
Welcome, ma'am.

00:19:49.798 --> 00:19:52.318
This is your table, ma'am.
Please be seated.

00:19:52.398 --> 00:19:53.224
Thank you.

00:20:03.598 --> 00:20:06.318
If the stars see you, they will ask you
about brightness.

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:07.638
Wow, so wonderful.

00:20:07.718 --> 00:20:10.998
"If the stars see you they will ask you
about brightness."

00:20:11.078 --> 00:20:13.958
"And the thirsty you
to quench their thirst."

00:20:14.238 --> 00:20:17.478
"Don't let your stole
slip from your shoulder..."

00:20:17.598 --> 00:20:20.558
"...otherwise,
even the old people will ask for youth."

00:20:20.638 --> 00:20:22.198
Wow. Wow.

00:20:22.278 --> 00:20:23.271
Wow. What a verse.

00:20:23.352 --> 00:20:25.552
I don't mess with drunkards like you.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.160
"May that drunkard die..."

00:20:29.678 --> 00:20:32.256
"...who chooses a glass over you."

00:20:32.337 --> 00:20:35.982
Wow. Wow.
- What a verse. Wow.

00:20:36.158 --> 00:20:39.518
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.230
"Friends, believe me."

00:20:43.838 --> 00:20:47.158
"Friend, merge
with this intoxication."

00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:50.958
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:58.358
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:20:59.238 --> 00:21:02.758
"Friends, believe me."

00:21:03.118 --> 00:21:06.118
"Friend, merge
with this intoxication."

00:21:06.878 --> 00:21:10.278
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:18.826
"Because since when I gave you my heart
I took a sweet pain."

00:21:18.907 --> 00:21:24.627
"Listen Priya,
I have given you my heart."

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:29.638
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:33.398
"Friends, believe me."

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.190
"Friend, merge
with this intoxication."

00:21:37.638 --> 00:21:41.638
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:22:08.438 --> 00:22:15.798
"I became crazy when our eyes met."

00:22:16.198 --> 00:22:22.758
"I was so affected that I was lost."

00:22:23.131 --> 00:22:26.877
"My steps are trembling.
My mind is trembling."

00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:31.798
"I have become crazy."

00:22:32.045 --> 00:22:37.885
"Listen Priya,
I have given you my heart."

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.758
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:22:43.118 --> 00:22:46.678
"Friends, believe me."

00:22:46.972 --> 00:22:50.772
"Friend,
merge with this intoxication."

00:22:50.918 --> 00:22:54.998
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:30.895
"The softness of the
storm is hidden in shut eyes."

00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:37.638
"The playfulness of clouds
is apparent in the sky."

00:23:38.278 --> 00:23:42.078
"This shyness, this attitude,
this smile, these eyes..."

00:23:42.158 --> 00:23:46.358
"...they have pierced
me in a sweet manner."

00:23:47.255 --> 00:23:53.015
"Listen, Priya,
I have given you my heart."

00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:57.943
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:01.678
"Friends, believe me."

00:24:02.078 --> 00:24:05.678
"Friend,
merge with this intoxication."

00:24:06.038 --> 00:24:09.598
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:24:10.838 --> 00:24:17.838
"Since I gave you my heart,
I took sweet pain."

00:24:18.078 --> 00:24:23.878
"Listen, Priya,
I have given you my heart."

00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:28.878
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:24:29.078 --> 00:24:32.118
"Friends, believe me."

00:24:32.878 --> 00:24:36.318
"Friend,
merge with this intoxication."

00:24:36.718 --> 00:24:40.438
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:44.238
"This is the intoxication of love."

00:24:44.438 --> 00:24:48.118
"Friends, believe me."

00:24:48.238 --> 00:24:52.198
"Friend,
merge with this intoxication."

00:24:56.438 --> 00:25:00.198
"Don't stay in your senses,
you crazy people."

00:25:06.718 --> 00:25:08.638
Oh, my God.

00:25:12.838 --> 00:25:14.118
What did you do? You fool.

00:25:14.238 --> 00:25:15.398
Move from here. Move.

00:25:15.518 --> 00:25:18.078
I am sorry, madam. I...
- Don't touch me.

00:25:18.198 --> 00:25:20.638
You animal.
What did you think about yourself?

00:25:20.878 --> 00:25:22.638
I have only heard about you till now.

00:25:22.758 --> 00:25:24.838
And from your deed I believe that...

00:25:24.918 --> 00:25:28.318
...you are the worst
rogue and a scoundrel.

00:25:28.398 --> 00:25:29.878
Who neither have any self respect...

00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:31.558
...nor know how to respect anybody.

00:25:31.638 --> 00:25:34.518
I hate your face.
I hate the sight of you.

00:26:01.696 --> 00:26:03.616
I won't repeat such mistake again.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:06.079
Forgive me, please.

00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:08.328
Forgive me, please.

00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:18.506
I am very sorry for what
happened last evening, Priya.

00:26:18.746 --> 00:26:20.146
Actually...
- Excuse me.

00:26:20.226 --> 00:26:21.426
Why are you telling me all this?

00:26:21.506 --> 00:26:22.946
I don't want to talk to you. Okay.

00:26:23.026 --> 00:26:27.186
Actually, I got carried
away because of the situation.

00:26:27.426 --> 00:26:32.306
And that lentils,
rice, Manchurian on your dress.

00:26:32.506 --> 00:26:33.946
That's why I have brought
this dress for you.

00:26:34.226 --> 00:26:35.826
I don't need this dress of yours.

00:26:35.907 --> 00:26:38.066
Stop bothering me, please.

00:26:38.146 --> 00:26:41.906
Look, I will never bother
you again if you take this dress.

00:26:42.146 --> 00:26:43.281
I promise.

00:26:45.506 --> 00:26:46.453
Okay.

00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:52.083
Then today evening
at 7 O' clock in your room or mine?

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:53.665
What?

00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:57.786
Then today evening
at 7 O' clock in your room or mine?

00:26:59.308 --> 00:27:01.788
7 O' clock in my room.

00:27:02.903 --> 00:27:04.823
You better believe
that I'll be there.

00:27:14.687 --> 00:27:15.781
Good evening.
- Hey, look that's Dev.

00:27:15.862 --> 00:27:17.462
Stop it. Let's go.

00:27:17.712 --> 00:27:18.672
Come.

00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:25.211
Hi.

00:27:25.592 --> 00:27:26.406
Oh!

00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:32.225
Beauty is like the moon,
and youth like a lotus.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.000
Seeing you I will
recite a nice sonnet.

00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:41.529
Oh, this fair body
is sculpted out of marble.

00:27:41.849 --> 00:27:44.489
People who see you think
they are looking at the Taj Mahal.

00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:50.129
You have recited a nice verse.
- Thank you.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.370
It seems you have told
it to a lot of girls.

00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:55.969
And you have also been
very successful with it, right?

00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.449
What are you saying?

00:27:57.649 --> 00:28:00.009
I thought of this poem right now,
just by looking you.

00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:01.602
Oh!
- Swear on you.

00:28:03.609 --> 00:28:05.969
It seems you are in a great hurry.

00:28:07.329 --> 00:28:08.849
What can I do, Priya?

00:28:09.009 --> 00:28:10.849
The ship is moving very fast.

00:28:11.049 --> 00:28:13.849
And time is moving faster than that.

00:28:14.489 --> 00:28:16.609
We shouldn't waste
a single moment, Priya.

00:28:16.906 --> 00:28:18.728
We shouldn't waste a single moment.

00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:21.453
Come. Let us merge within each other.

00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:29.911
Elder brother?

00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:34.088
Father.
- No.

00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.191
Uncle.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.060
Absolutely not.

00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:39.181
My future husband.

00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:41.991
He is alive.

00:28:42.745 --> 00:28:44.665
He is alive and also healthy.

00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:47.981
And if he sees you
in such a condition...

00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:51.471
...it may be fatal for your health.

00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:54.351
Is it?

00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:04.516
I am sorry,
but it seems like a good fit.

00:29:04.608 --> 00:29:06.768
Hey.
- Well, this is my opinion.

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:08.985
Keep your opinion to yourself.

00:29:09.066 --> 00:29:12.626
Everyone seems to think
that it's a perfect fit.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.920
Do you understand?

00:29:15.611 --> 00:29:17.771
I have nearly understood.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.110
Tell me one thing.

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:23.991
Have you ever cheated.
A small mistake maybe?

00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:28.351
It took three or days,
maybe three or four hours.

00:29:28.431 --> 00:29:30.751
No. I haven't.

00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:32.781
And I have no intentions to either.

00:29:33.557 --> 00:29:35.071
All right.

00:29:35.936 --> 00:29:37.070
Typical Indian woman.

00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:38.453
Yes. What did you say?

00:29:38.534 --> 00:29:40.230
No, no, I wanted to say that...

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:44.297
I am very happy to meet
an honourable Indian woman like you.

00:29:44.976 --> 00:29:47.296
Good night. Jai Hind.

00:29:47.431 --> 00:29:48.711
Where are you going?

00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:51.351
We were about to spend
the entire evening together.

00:29:52.883 --> 00:29:57.574
I was thought so,
but I suddenly remembered my mother.

00:29:57.831 --> 00:30:00.703
And I want to sit in
front of her picture and cry.

00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:02.729
Was it your mother or your grandma?

00:30:02.871 --> 00:30:04.991
What did you say?
- I said, so sad.

00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:06.571
Come I will see you to the door.

00:30:06.652 --> 00:30:08.906
No, no, I will manage.
- How can that be?

00:30:08.987 --> 00:30:12.227
It is the duty of every host
to see their guest till the door.

00:30:12.424 --> 00:30:14.664
Come. Come.

00:30:14.857 --> 00:30:16.457
Come. Come.

00:30:16.552 --> 00:30:18.992
Okay, good night. Sleep tight.

00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:24.791
You got into a no entry zone.

00:30:25.071 --> 00:30:27.311
Come on, Dev, take a U-turn.

00:30:31.591 --> 00:30:32.911
Sorry For The Break.

00:30:32.991 --> 00:30:34.231
Try Your Luck Elsewhere.

00:30:34.471 --> 00:30:36.031
You're game plan isn't
going to work here.

00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:40.991
You're game plan isn't
going to work here.

00:30:45.831 --> 00:30:47.271
Did you get hurt?

00:30:47.431 --> 00:30:53.391
Is your small ego wounded,
Mr. Dev Karan Singh?

00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:56.431
Oh, no, no. I enjoyed it in fact.

00:30:56.991 --> 00:30:59.471
For the first time
I have met someone equal to me.

00:31:00.471 --> 00:31:01.991
Shall I tell you one thing?
- Yes.

00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:04.471
Can we at least be friends?

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:08.109
I mean to say that no hanky-panky,
no pranks.

00:31:08.391 --> 00:31:11.391
Only hundred per
cent pure friendship.

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:13.228
Pure friendship?

00:31:13.484 --> 00:31:15.101
I swear on all the pretty ladies.

00:31:16.351 --> 00:31:17.221
Agreed?

00:31:19.603 --> 00:31:20.687
Agreed.

00:31:21.631 --> 00:31:24.551
Friend, I am very hungry.
Will you treat me to dinner?

00:31:24.631 --> 00:31:27.191
Why not? My pleasure.

00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:32.191
Interesting. Very interesting.

00:31:32.751 --> 00:31:36.511
Dev, the way you talk about woman...

00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:39.151
...I don't think you respect them.

00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:41.191
Wrong, absolutely, wrong.

00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:44.111
Trust me. I respect women a lot.

00:31:44.271 --> 00:31:46.511
I keep them here, up.

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.831
That means you hang them in the air.

00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:51.591
No, no, up on the throne.

00:31:52.591 --> 00:31:56.551
But as I start getting
to know them...

00:31:56.831 --> 00:32:00.511
...the throne slowly
starts coming down.

00:32:00.591 --> 00:32:03.351
Yes, then it starts shaking,
shivering.

00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:05.951
And then it falls down
and turns into pieces. Right?

00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:07.551
Absolutely right.

00:32:08.582 --> 00:32:11.702
You could break someone's
heart because of these pranks?

00:32:11.991 --> 00:32:13.951
Yes, many hearts have been broken.

00:32:14.191 --> 00:32:15.431
What can be done now?

00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:26.694
You have called me a friend, Dev.

00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:29.601
So can I tell you something
for the sake of friendship?

00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:33.751
You win people's trust
and then you break it.

00:32:35.271 --> 00:32:37.351
It is easy to win someone's trust.

00:32:37.671 --> 00:32:40.031
It is even easier to break it.

00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:43.431
But it is difficult
to keep that trust.

00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:48.871
A true man doesn't breech trust,
but insures its existence.

00:32:50.532 --> 00:32:52.052
Don't you think so?

00:32:56.366 --> 00:32:58.926
Excuse me, sir.
May I repeat your drink?

00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:00.951
No, thank you.
- Okay.

00:33:01.591 --> 00:33:03.711
You didn't answer my question, Dev.

00:33:06.671 --> 00:33:08.671
We have talked a lot about me.

00:33:09.191 --> 00:33:10.591
Tell me something about yourself.

00:33:13.111 --> 00:33:14.271
We will talk about me, tomorrow.

00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:16.631
Why tomorrow?
We have the entire evening.

00:33:16.991 --> 00:33:19.831
We also have the whole day
tomorrow to do just that. Good night.

00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:37.111
Good morning.
- Morning.

00:33:37.631 --> 00:33:39.351
How did you spend the night?
- Nicely.

00:33:39.431 --> 00:33:41.311
After you stopped bothering me.

00:33:43.916 --> 00:33:44.956
Yes?

00:33:45.311 --> 00:33:46.991
What?
- Did you say something?

00:33:47.071 --> 00:33:47.831
Nothing.

00:33:48.151 --> 00:33:50.391
But you were about to
say something about yourself.

00:33:52.191 --> 00:33:56.751
By the way my story is not
as interesting as yours. Well.

00:33:57.311 --> 00:34:00.991
I was 2 years old when my
parents died in a car accident.

00:34:01.711 --> 00:34:03.791
I was raised in an orphanage in Pune.

00:34:03.991 --> 00:34:05.191
And when I grew up
I started teaching...

00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:07.191
...music and dance
to the children there.

00:34:07.391 --> 00:34:11.351
One day, he came as a chief guest
to one of our charity programmes.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.830
Who is he? That person in the photo?

00:34:14.509 --> 00:34:15.296
Yes.

00:34:15.751 --> 00:34:19.511
After our programme he proposed...
- What?

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:20.831
In the first meeting.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.470
...that we should open a music
academy in Mumbai. - All right.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.990
And I accepted.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.470
Then after a few days
he proposed marriage.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:32.206
I even accepted that.

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:34.245
That's it, Dev.

00:34:34.391 --> 00:34:36.591
My life is now an open book.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:39.230
Hey. That's just one page.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.790
Yes, Dev.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.350
It's a one paged book.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.937
Hold it. Hold it.

00:34:53.018 --> 00:34:55.058
Statue. Smile.

00:34:57.791 --> 00:34:59.431
Dev, stop him.
- Wow. Wonderful.

00:34:59.551 --> 00:35:01.751
Thank you.
- Hi, Black Beauty.

00:35:01.831 --> 00:35:03.374
Hi.
- Your camera is very nice.

00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:05.735
It is imported. Made in Singapore.

00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:06.991
It cost me dollar 500.

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.111
It takes good pictures.
- Really?

00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:10.870
Let me see.
- Yes, look, look, look, look.

00:35:10.951 --> 00:35:12.591
Wow. All right, how does it open.

00:35:12.671 --> 00:35:14.762
Look here.
- Like this. Okay.

00:35:14.843 --> 00:35:16.512
And the roll comes out like this.

00:35:16.976 --> 00:35:19.816
Hey, there is nothing in it.
- There is.. There isn't. Hey.

00:35:20.512 --> 00:35:22.598
You have thrown my roll.

00:35:22.848 --> 00:35:26.035
I should have thrown the camera too.
- Yes. No, no.

00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:31.951
Yes, I know,
I know why you have thrown my camera.

00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.591
So that people shouldn't
get to know that...

00:35:33.671 --> 00:35:35.711
...you're the two of you
are having fun surreptitiously.

00:35:35.791 --> 00:35:39.831
But I will tell everyone
about your four-day interlude.

00:35:39.976 --> 00:35:41.216
Hey, watch it.

00:35:41.319 --> 00:35:43.199
Hey, fool.
- Don't come forward.

00:35:43.311 --> 00:35:44.431
Don't beat me.
- Come on, move it.

00:35:44.511 --> 00:35:46.871
I won't spare you. I will defame you.

00:35:46.952 --> 00:35:48.392
I will tell the whole world.

00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:49.951
I won't spare you.
- Hey, Priya, where are you going?

00:35:50.031 --> 00:35:52.431
I have seen what happens with you.

00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:53.991
But Priya, we are just friends.

00:35:54.111 --> 00:35:57.431
Mr. Dev even if you sit
with a glass of milk at a bar...

00:35:57.511 --> 00:35:59.285
...the world will think
that you are drinking wine.

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:03.326
That's why I will go my way.
And you go your way.

00:36:03.485 --> 00:36:05.925
But Priya.
- Dev, please.

00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:11.471
Dev, go your own way.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.800
Wow. I have found my path.

00:36:20.151 --> 00:36:21.997
Hi.
- Hi.

00:36:22.078 --> 00:36:24.558
I just remembered
a sonnet seeing you, madam.

00:36:24.738 --> 00:36:28.021
Beauty is like the moon,
and youth like a lotus.

00:36:28.178 --> 00:36:31.099
Seeing you I will
recite a nice sonnet.

00:36:31.203 --> 00:36:35.083
Oh, this fair body
sculpted out of marble.

00:36:35.338 --> 00:36:38.218
People who see you will think that
they are looking at the Taj Mahal.

00:36:39.538 --> 00:36:40.818
What did you think?

00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:42.654
By the way,
I am known as Dev Karan Singh.

00:36:43.204 --> 00:36:44.004
I know that.

00:36:44.085 --> 00:36:45.645
By the way
what are you doing in the evening?

00:36:45.726 --> 00:36:46.766
Nothing.
- Very good.

00:36:46.857 --> 00:36:48.323
I have got something
that you will enjoy.

00:36:48.404 --> 00:36:49.484
Is it?
- Actually...

00:36:58.316 --> 00:36:59.676
Hi, Dev.

00:36:59.771 --> 00:37:02.531
Hi, beautiful. How are you?

00:37:03.772 --> 00:37:06.492
Kamini, looking at
you I feel that after you...

00:37:06.573 --> 00:37:09.773
...God stopped making
beautiful girls.

00:37:10.026 --> 00:37:11.038
Thank you.

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.396
My God, how I've missed you.

00:37:19.205 --> 00:37:23.565
Now you will have to see from afar.

00:37:24.027 --> 00:37:29.381
And now that rascal is tweeting
with a cuckoo called Kamini.

00:37:29.851 --> 00:37:33.331
My Popat had decorated
such a nice nest in his dreams.

00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:34.731
Yes, Popat's mother.

00:37:34.931 --> 00:37:38.324
Where daughter-in-law and me,
and three, four more parrots...

00:37:38.405 --> 00:37:39.931
...would have stayed happily.

00:37:40.011 --> 00:37:43.891
But this foolish girl left
this parrot and went with that crow.

00:37:44.571 --> 00:37:48.651
Yes and that crow
pecked at her and flied.

00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:52.467
Stop it.
What nonsense are you saying?

00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:55.410
Look, nothing has happened between
me and Dev like you people think.

00:37:55.491 --> 00:37:59.051
Oh, yes. Every girl says
the same thing after being dumped.

00:37:59.171 --> 00:38:00.691
Just stop it.

00:38:00.891 --> 00:38:03.411
You don't believe it.
I will just prove it.

00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.371
Yes do, do it.

00:38:06.731 --> 00:38:07.811
Dev.

00:38:09.371 --> 00:38:11.491
Dev, please come down for minute.

00:38:12.011 --> 00:38:13.931
No, right now.
I am little busy now. Yes...

00:38:14.051 --> 00:38:16.331
Dev, listen to me.
I have talk an urgent matter with you.

00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.171
Please.
- I told you I am busy.

00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:20.011
Shall we go to the restaurant?

00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:21.491
Okay. - Come on. Let's go.
-Dev.

00:38:21.624 --> 00:38:23.405
He will not listen.
He will not listen.

00:38:23.523 --> 00:38:26.603
Now that smart crow won't
listen to your twitters.

00:38:26.683 --> 00:38:31.523
The poor girl has no other
way besides drowning in a river.

00:38:31.803 --> 00:38:33.043
May her enemies die.

00:38:33.123 --> 00:38:35.083
I will marry her.
- Yes, daughter-in-law.

00:38:35.163 --> 00:38:38.163
Take this Rs. 1 and 25 paise
and accept my son.

00:38:38.963 --> 00:38:40.243
Hold on to it...

00:38:40.323 --> 00:38:42.563
...otherwise this might
pass you by as well.

00:38:55.003 --> 00:38:57.843
The poor girl is
eating her food alone.

00:38:58.225 --> 00:39:00.139
Priya! Hi!

00:39:02.763 --> 00:39:04.403
Priya. Priya.

00:39:04.546 --> 00:39:05.866
Priya, listen to me?

00:39:06.123 --> 00:39:08.243
You are running away from me,
as if I am a ghost.

00:39:08.403 --> 00:39:09.683
You are worse than a ghost.

00:39:09.763 --> 00:39:11.123
You are danger. Danger.

00:39:11.283 --> 00:39:12.723
And I want to stay away from you.

00:39:13.003 --> 00:39:15.563
It has become difficult for
me to leave the cabin because of you.

00:39:15.643 --> 00:39:17.562
People are saying
terrible things about me.

00:39:17.643 --> 00:39:19.323
Forget about people. Listen to me.

00:39:19.443 --> 00:39:20.963
Come, sit here. Sit.

00:39:21.683 --> 00:39:23.123
Bring two coffees.
- Yes, sir.

00:39:23.243 --> 00:39:26.843
Look tomorrow morning, the ship is
going to halt at a beautiful island...

00:39:27.123 --> 00:39:30.163
...where there are flowing streams.

00:39:30.643 --> 00:39:34.003
There are fragrant valleys
and it is very picturesque.

00:39:34.283 --> 00:39:36.443
So you want me to come
with you there, right?

00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:37.843
Who is talking about you?

00:39:38.123 --> 00:39:40.217
I want to take Kamini there.

00:39:42.563 --> 00:39:43.843
So? Take her.

00:39:44.043 --> 00:39:44.923
Why have you come to me?

00:39:45.043 --> 00:39:46.202
You want my permission.

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:48.603
Darling, I need your help.

00:39:49.483 --> 00:39:51.443
Kamini's younger
brother has revealed...

00:39:51.523 --> 00:39:53.603
...my plans to his mother.

00:39:54.003 --> 00:39:55.563
Why did God create children?

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:57.203
Why doesn't he send
them directly as adults?

00:39:57.323 --> 00:40:00.763
Well, now her mother has stopped
her from going anywhere alone.

00:40:00.883 --> 00:40:03.043
So, how can I help you in this?

00:40:04.003 --> 00:40:05.443
You have to fool her mother, and...

00:40:05.563 --> 00:40:07.643
...bring her tomorrow
morning to the island.

00:40:08.562 --> 00:40:11.762
And you want me to support you
in this evil prank of yours?

00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:13.003
Yes.
- I am sorry.

00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:13.763
Hey.

00:40:14.043 --> 00:40:15.723
Priya. Look, Priya, don't say no.

00:40:15.963 --> 00:40:17.403
Only a friend helps a friend.

00:40:17.576 --> 00:40:19.416
Friend! Get lost.

00:40:19.563 --> 00:40:20.436
Please, Priya.

00:40:22.043 --> 00:40:23.203
What are you doing? Leave me.

00:40:23.283 --> 00:40:25.397
I won't leave you.
- Dev, everyone is watching.

00:40:25.794 --> 00:40:27.311
Let them see.
-Hey, he..

00:40:28.722 --> 00:40:30.562
Dev, I have already been defamed.
Leave me.

00:40:30.643 --> 00:40:32.323
I won't leave you.
Till you don't say yes.

00:40:32.404 --> 00:40:34.564
I swear on our friendship,
I won't leave you.

00:40:35.043 --> 00:40:37.483
Yes, I will do it. Leave me now.

00:40:37.643 --> 00:40:39.483
First swear on that
person on the photograph.

00:40:39.612 --> 00:40:41.372
I swear on the person in
the photograph. Leave me now.

00:40:41.453 --> 00:40:43.397
Yes, thank you.
You are so sweet.

00:40:43.581 --> 00:40:46.061
Tomorrow at 10 O' clock,
Oriental Bazaar, okay?

00:40:47.617 --> 00:40:49.537
And listen. Don't be late.

00:41:03.163 --> 00:41:04.404
Hi, Kamini.

00:41:04.558 --> 00:41:06.558
Hi, Dev.
- Hi.

00:41:07.909 --> 00:41:10.245
Come, my darling, come.
- Oh, Dev.

00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:12.740
Oh, baby.

00:41:13.603 --> 00:41:14.843
Oh Kamini.

00:41:14.948 --> 00:41:16.717
I thought,
we will be never able to meet.

00:41:16.926 --> 00:41:19.566
You know, I couldn't sleep
the entire night thinking about you.

00:41:19.647 --> 00:41:21.670
Oh, I also missed you so much,
sweetheart.

00:41:21.751 --> 00:41:24.671
Did you, baby.
Honey, you are so sweet?

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.300
I love you, darling.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.740
Oh, Priya,
thank you for you know what.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.140
Look Dev, we have to
reach the ship by 6 o' clock.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.940
Let's meet at 5:45.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.500
Okay. Come, Kamini.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.340
Come.
- Dev, you are leaving me alone.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.780
What did you think? One minute.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.100
Come here.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.540
What are you doing, Priya?
Why do you want to be a third wheel?

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.500
But Dev, what will I do here alone
the whole day?

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.340
You... Yes, look there.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.220
There is Buddhist temple there.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.900
There are religious books there.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.980
Pass time reading them.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.060
Dev...
- Okay, bye.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.460
Did you say something?

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.340
No. - But I have to
tell you something.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.980
You are a darling.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.460
You are a sweetheart.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.787
You are simply superb.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.540
And a true friend.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.300
Okay, we will meet in the evening.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.450
Come on darling.
- Come.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.451
You are a darling.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.660
You are a sweetheart.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.700
You are simply superb.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:45.940
"Why does my heart love you?
My heart."

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:56.580
"Who knows what forged
this relationship?"

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:06.700
"Why does my heart love you?
My heart."

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:18.420
"Who knows what forged
this relationship?"

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:26.140
"What is this craziness?
What is this madness?"

00:44:29.142 --> 00:44:38.782
"Why does my heart love you?
My heart."

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:10.220
"What did you do to make me crazy?"

00:45:10.301 --> 00:45:17.101
"You robbed my dreams.
You even took my peace."

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.860
"You are my heart and my life."

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.260
"You are still innocent."

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.180
"You are ignorant in love."

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:40.460
"Why does my heart love you?
My heart."

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:52.220
"Who knows what forged
this relationship?"

00:45:52.540 --> 00:46:00.340
"What is this craziness?
What is this madness?"

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:13.380
"Why does my heart love? My heart."

00:46:13.733 --> 00:46:16.093
"My heart."

00:46:16.989 --> 00:46:20.189
"My heart."

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.820
Help.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.500
Help.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.260
Oh god.
- Help me.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.220
Priya.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.980
Help.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.620
Help. Help!

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.340
Have you gone mad?

00:47:12.597 --> 00:47:14.317
You would have died
if you fell from here?

00:47:14.764 --> 00:47:16.004
By the way, what were you doing here?

00:47:16.085 --> 00:47:18.285
I was following you.
- Why?

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.561
I don't know.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.100
Take me back to the ship.

00:47:29.749 --> 00:47:30.686
Please.

00:47:52.187 --> 00:47:53.507
Have you gone mad?

00:47:53.655 --> 00:47:55.575
You would have died
if you have fallen from here?

00:47:55.775 --> 00:47:56.935
By the way, what were you doing here?

00:47:57.255 --> 00:47:59.415
I was following you.
- Why?

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:01.615
I don't know.

00:48:01.996 --> 00:48:05.196
Take me back to the ship.

00:48:10.459 --> 00:48:11.339
Dev, come.

00:48:11.538 --> 00:48:13.298
Both, mummy and Chintu
have gone to the movie theatre.

00:48:13.418 --> 00:48:16.818
We have got 3 hours.
Tell me, in your room or mine?

00:48:17.498 --> 00:48:19.098
Kamini, I want to talk to you.

00:48:19.218 --> 00:48:21.098
This is not the time to talk,
Dev. Come.

00:48:21.178 --> 00:48:22.038
Kamini.

00:48:22.898 --> 00:48:23.778
Listen...

00:48:24.498 --> 00:48:26.098
...the way we are
travelling is wrong.

00:48:26.338 --> 00:48:27.258
What's wrong?

00:48:27.378 --> 00:48:29.298
We will get married
when we will reach Mumbai.

00:48:29.418 --> 00:48:32.298
And then Dev, we love each other.

00:48:32.458 --> 00:48:35.338
No, Kamini, I don't love you.

00:48:35.544 --> 00:48:36.460
What?

00:48:37.098 --> 00:48:39.858
In the last 3 days you
have told me 300 times...

00:48:40.024 --> 00:48:41.904
...that you love me, Dev.

00:48:42.778 --> 00:48:44.058
I lied to you.

00:48:44.258 --> 00:48:45.178
But why?

00:48:45.378 --> 00:48:47.418
Because I wanted to amuse myself.

00:48:48.218 --> 00:48:51.058
And you would have left me
after you were amused.

00:48:51.193 --> 00:48:52.030
Yes.

00:48:52.818 --> 00:48:53.936
You cheat.

00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.296
You bluff.

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:12.938
I liked watching a great
dacoit turning into a saint.

00:49:13.978 --> 00:49:15.858
And you have also seen the result.

00:49:17.938 --> 00:49:20.738
I have done this for the first time.
- Yes.

00:49:20.898 --> 00:49:23.218
And I don't know why I did it.

00:49:25.058 --> 00:49:27.938
Maybe your talks are affecting
me a little too much.

00:49:28.778 --> 00:49:31.938
That's why madam, you go your way.

00:49:32.258 --> 00:49:34.778
And let me go my way.

00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:40.938
Thank you for saving my life.

00:52:19.738 --> 00:52:22.818
Wonderful. Very good.

00:52:32.334 --> 00:52:35.454
Wow, Priya.
You set the stage on fire today.

00:52:35.649 --> 00:52:38.304
There bound to be a fire
with this fuel around.

00:52:38.385 --> 00:52:39.705
What?
What did you say?

00:52:40.425 --> 00:52:42.905
I was saying that we're stopping
at another island tomorrow.

00:52:43.305 --> 00:52:45.425
Have you chosen anyone among them?

00:52:45.745 --> 00:52:48.585
No, Priya. Someone is
waiting for me on the island.

00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:53.705
All right,
so there is a girl at every port.

00:52:53.785 --> 00:52:56.745
No, no, actually tomorrow
I am going to meet my Grandma.

00:53:05.545 --> 00:53:07.025
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:53:08.025 --> 00:53:11.265
This man,
Mr. Dev Karan Singh is going...

00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:15.906
...to meet his grandma
on the island tomorrow.

00:53:20.825 --> 00:53:23.835
Why are you joking, Priya?
- I'm really going to meet my Grandma.

00:53:23.916 --> 00:53:28.116
All right, then I will also go to
meet your 16-year-old grandma.

00:53:28.225 --> 00:53:29.985
Okay, grandpa.

00:53:42.265 --> 00:53:43.625
Good morning.

00:53:43.745 --> 00:53:45.665
Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:53:45.795 --> 00:53:48.115
If you sign your on the photograph...

00:53:48.196 --> 00:53:50.676
...my every morning will be good.

00:53:50.945 --> 00:53:51.895
Please.
- Give.

00:53:53.387 --> 00:53:55.507
Hey, this is our picture.

00:53:56.602 --> 00:53:58.842
What is this nonsense?
Aren't you ashamed?

00:53:58.938 --> 00:54:01.658
You are hiding and clicking
our photographs. Hold it.

00:54:06.026 --> 00:54:07.986
What will happen
by tearing one picture?

00:54:08.067 --> 00:54:10.787
There is an entire
shop of your photographs?

00:54:10.868 --> 00:54:13.762
One picture is being
sold for dollar 100.

00:54:13.843 --> 00:54:15.563
What?
- Oh, yes.

00:54:16.745 --> 00:54:18.025
Wait here.

00:54:18.305 --> 00:54:21.304
See, this is Dev
and Priya's love story.

00:54:21.385 --> 00:54:23.345
Dance on the boat.

00:54:23.585 --> 00:54:26.105
One photograph free for every
two photographs.

00:54:26.185 --> 00:54:27.345
Absolutely free.

00:54:27.465 --> 00:54:29.945
Pictures of Dev and
Priya's love story.

00:54:30.026 --> 00:54:32.386
He has come. Run. Run.

00:54:32.467 --> 00:54:33.985
Leave my collar.

00:54:34.065 --> 00:54:35.665
Leave my collar.
- It was his idea.

00:54:35.745 --> 00:54:37.145
It was not my idea.
- It was his idea.

00:54:37.225 --> 00:54:39.665
I will beat you, if you lie.
- Shut up.

00:54:40.585 --> 00:54:44.385
Bring all our photographs...

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:45.987
...otherwise, you clown...

00:54:46.131 --> 00:54:47.971
...I'll put an end to you act.

00:54:48.265 --> 00:54:50.065
And listen, you fool...

00:54:50.217 --> 00:54:52.057
...I am not worried about my honour.

00:54:52.138 --> 00:54:54.338
But Priya is a very decent girl.

00:54:54.466 --> 00:54:55.786
I respect her a lot.

00:54:57.818 --> 00:55:01.458
Nobody will be worse than me,
if Priya is defamed even a little.

00:55:02.226 --> 00:55:04.946
Now keep these pictures
here and run from here.

00:55:05.905 --> 00:55:07.705
Come. Come.

00:55:09.065 --> 00:55:12.985
Dev, did anyone tell you
that you look great in anger.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:17.610
By the way you look
great even like this.

00:55:17.785 --> 00:55:20.345
Look these pictures.
They are so nice.

00:55:20.722 --> 00:55:21.962
Shall I keep it?

00:55:22.505 --> 00:55:24.105
You are amazing Priya.

00:55:24.866 --> 00:55:27.226
Till yesterday you objected
to be seen with me.

00:55:27.571 --> 00:55:28.851
And today you...
- Dev...

00:55:29.082 --> 00:55:31.442
...people talk when
I'm seen with you...

00:55:31.523 --> 00:55:33.803
...they talk even more when I'm not.

00:55:33.884 --> 00:55:36.284
So it's good that I am seen with you.
Isn't it?

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:40.754
Now, can we go to meet
your darling grandma?

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.080
Grandpa.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.200
I wish you would trust
me some day, Priya.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.080
To tell you the truth, Dev.

00:55:52.528 --> 00:55:54.888
I have started to trust you a little.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.160
Can we leave now?

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.434
Let's go.

00:56:11.606 --> 00:56:12.446
Come, Priya.

00:56:13.222 --> 00:56:14.051
Grandma.

00:56:17.097 --> 00:56:18.297
Grandma.

00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:24.755
Grandma is at the temple.

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.795
Wow!

00:56:34.115 --> 00:56:36.155
This place is so beautiful.

00:56:36.555 --> 00:56:39.395
It's peaceful.

00:56:40.075 --> 00:56:44.235
It's so still as
if it is some pretty dream world.

00:56:45.155 --> 00:56:49.395
This is the dream world,
where my grandparents live.

00:56:49.995 --> 00:56:52.635
Both of them have came
here to spend their honeymoon.

00:56:53.515 --> 00:56:55.955
That's when they decided
that they will make...

00:56:56.235 --> 00:57:00.755
...a small house here and
spend the last years of their life.

00:57:01.235 --> 00:57:02.675
Together.

00:57:03.955 --> 00:57:06.075
Grandpa passed away 2 years ago.

00:57:07.115 --> 00:57:10.395
And since then Grandma
is waiting for that day...

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.195
...when she...

00:57:27.795 --> 00:57:28.793
Grandma.

00:57:34.275 --> 00:57:35.755
Grandma.

00:57:36.235 --> 00:57:40.155
My dear. My lovely child.

00:57:40.755 --> 00:57:43.235
I have seen you after so many days.

00:57:43.795 --> 00:57:46.355
My sweet little baby boyfriend.

00:57:46.955 --> 00:57:49.715
My sweet little old girl friend.

00:57:51.172 --> 00:57:53.212
I am so happy to see you.

00:57:59.115 --> 00:58:00.475
She...

00:58:01.798 --> 00:58:03.638
She is my daughter-in-law to-be?

00:58:04.348 --> 00:58:06.668
No, no, grandma. It's not her.

00:58:07.196 --> 00:58:08.356
She is my friend.

00:58:08.989 --> 00:58:10.389
Come. I will introduce her to you.

00:58:10.903 --> 00:58:12.383
Come, Granny.

00:58:12.623 --> 00:58:13.692
Careful.

00:58:15.943 --> 00:58:19.303
Granny, this is Priya.
And Priya this is grandma.

00:58:20.303 --> 00:58:21.903
Live long, dear.

00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:27.069
Grandma thought that
you are my future...

00:58:29.103 --> 00:58:32.663
Actually I wanted to say
that you are very beautiful.

00:58:34.063 --> 00:58:36.183
Grandma,
this place of yours is beautiful.

00:58:37.063 --> 00:58:39.103
I feel like spending
my whole life here.

00:58:39.303 --> 00:58:41.023
Don't say that, dear.

00:58:42.103 --> 00:58:46.903
This place is great for
reminiscing and relaxing.

00:58:47.543 --> 00:58:50.463
But you have to create
memories before you come here.

00:58:55.423 --> 00:58:57.943
Grandma, your temple
seems to be very beautiful.

00:58:58.143 --> 00:59:01.012
Can I go and see?
- Why not, dear? Go.

00:59:06.303 --> 00:59:07.663
And you, Dev...

00:59:08.023 --> 00:59:10.143
...how many years has it
been since you visited a temple?

00:59:10.703 --> 00:59:14.343
Granny, I...
- Go, God will not eat you up.

00:59:15.103 --> 00:59:16.004
Go.

00:59:28.983 --> 00:59:32.343
'So much innocence.
So much simplicity.'

00:59:32.863 --> 00:59:35.423
'It seems as if some fairy
has come down from the sky.'

00:59:35.783 --> 00:59:37.943
Yes, did you say something?

00:59:38.143 --> 00:59:40.463
No, no. That...

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:42.263
Pray quietly.

00:59:46.571 --> 00:59:48.477
Coconuts from the farm, ma'am.
- Leave all that.

00:59:48.558 --> 00:59:50.203
Do you know who has come?
- Who has come, ma'am?

00:59:50.284 --> 00:59:53.407
Dev, dear has come.
- Dev, dear.

00:59:53.488 --> 00:59:55.128
Hi, Ajinomoto.

00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:58.981
How are you?
- I am fine, sir.

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.262
And how is your family planning?

01:00:00.343 --> 01:00:03.103
It's not family planning, Dev.
Say upbringing.

01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:05.371
Is it? Why?
- I will tell you.

01:00:05.886 --> 01:00:08.246
It's the same Indian hypocrisy here.

01:00:08.733 --> 01:00:10.413
They consider girls to be goddesses.

01:00:10.716 --> 01:00:12.596
In spite of that boys
are always preferred.

01:00:13.213 --> 01:00:16.786
For one boy, they had 11 girls.

01:00:17.628 --> 01:00:19.028
Even this time?
- Twins.

01:00:19.205 --> 01:00:20.965
Well done.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.970
Grandma,
I will go and meet his family.

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:25.130
You guys chat.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.585
Come, dear.
- Come on, Ajinomoto.

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:27.541
Come.

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:32.543
Grandma, Dev painted this?

01:00:32.624 --> 01:00:37.144
Yes, I remember clearly.
While giving me this painting...

01:00:37.809 --> 01:00:43.009
...Dev narrated a story
as thought I was a small girl...

01:00:44.002 --> 01:00:46.162
...he was my Grandpa.

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:49.901
Give it to me, Grandma.
I will apply it.

01:00:49.982 --> 01:00:51.348
No, no.
Of course, not. No.

01:00:51.475 --> 01:00:53.514
Give it to me, Grandma.
When will I get such a chance again?

01:00:53.595 --> 01:00:55.195
Give it to me, please.

01:00:55.715 --> 01:00:57.355
All right, here.

01:00:58.232 --> 01:00:59.592
Spoil me.

01:01:00.715 --> 01:01:01.755
Take.

01:01:11.475 --> 01:01:13.915
Grandma, shall I tell one thing?
- Yes.

01:01:13.995 --> 01:01:19.475
I was surprised to know that Dev
knows so much about the scriptures.

01:01:19.595 --> 01:01:20.715
Is it?
- Yes.

01:01:20.795 --> 01:01:23.315
Then you will be more
surprised to learn that...

01:01:23.515 --> 01:01:25.875
...Dev writes very good poetry too.

01:01:26.075 --> 01:01:28.555
He always excelled in studies.

01:01:28.795 --> 01:01:33.875
It was his bobby to learn
new languages, meet new people.

01:01:33.995 --> 01:01:34.955
Is it?

01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:38.315
In his childhood
he used to amuse everyone...

01:01:38.435 --> 01:01:40.315
...with his tactics and skills.

01:01:43.155 --> 01:01:44.435
That's it, dear.

01:01:44.795 --> 01:01:49.115
The problem is his mind wavers a lot.

01:01:49.595 --> 01:01:51.475
It doesn't stay put at one place...

01:01:52.051 --> 01:01:55.698
...with one thing or one person.

01:01:59.235 --> 01:02:03.755
It seems like he is
searching for something.

01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:10.787
The path that he's on scares me.

01:02:11.835 --> 01:02:17.315
When life claims its debts,
Dev won't be able to pay up.

01:02:22.355 --> 01:02:27.435
But my heart says
that if he gets a girl...

01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:29.795
...who would love him truly...

01:02:30.435 --> 01:02:32.315
...show him the right way...

01:02:32.635 --> 01:02:34.755
...then my Dev can change.

01:02:35.325 --> 01:02:36.685
Things can happen for him.

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:39.526
Isn't it?

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:46.595
Yes, Grandma, these anklets
of yours are very beautiful.

01:02:46.915 --> 01:02:48.635
You like them?
- Yes.

01:02:49.115 --> 01:02:50.715
One day I will send them to you.

01:02:50.835 --> 01:02:53.075
No Grandma, there is no need...
- Why not?

01:02:53.155 --> 01:02:55.715
I gave you a chance to serve me.

01:02:55.835 --> 01:02:59.195
Why won't you give me
a chance to shower my love.

01:03:03.635 --> 01:03:05.675
Sorry, Grandma. I made a mistake.

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:14.995
Now look, don't move.

01:03:18.548 --> 01:03:20.828
Here, Dev has come. Come, dear. Come.

01:03:21.235 --> 01:03:23.385
Come, come.
We were not talking anything special.

01:03:23.519 --> 01:03:26.319
Granny was relating stories
from your childhood.

01:03:26.635 --> 01:03:27.635
Is it?

01:03:27.955 --> 01:03:29.627
What did you say, grandma?

01:03:29.763 --> 01:03:32.443
Grandma was saying that
when your wishes were not...

01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:34.964
...fulfilled in your
childhood then you used to...

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:37.035
...lie on the ground and make
your face red, crying.

01:03:37.115 --> 01:03:38.355
Is it?

01:03:38.995 --> 01:03:40.115
And what did you say?

01:03:40.235 --> 01:03:43.080
I was saying you don't do this now.

01:03:43.314 --> 01:03:47.754
Now, when your wishes are
not fulfilled, only your ego is hurt.

01:03:47.955 --> 01:03:48.932
Right?

01:03:49.915 --> 01:03:52.875
Ego is hurt? What do you mean?

01:03:52.994 --> 01:03:56.314
Nothing, Grandma. She's in
the habit of talking in riddles.

01:03:56.756 --> 01:03:59.756
Now leave and take this.

01:04:00.035 --> 01:04:01.835
A small gift for you.

01:04:01.915 --> 01:04:05.555
No, dear.
It's not my age to accept gifts.

01:04:05.636 --> 01:04:09.156
Just accept it, Grandma.
Your youth will return.

01:04:09.315 --> 01:04:10.182
Is it?

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:12.995
In that case I will
have to accept it.

01:04:13.555 --> 01:04:14.627
Let's see.

01:04:29.475 --> 01:04:31.155
This is his Grandpa.

01:04:31.915 --> 01:04:33.795
His face is so bright.

01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:36.324
How did you make this picture?

01:04:36.454 --> 01:04:39.054
The face was in my mind,
I just put it on canvas.

01:04:39.844 --> 01:04:43.324
I told my Dev is very skilled.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.940
Tell me the truth, Grandma.
How do you like this picture?

01:04:47.595 --> 01:04:53.096
Dev, if pictures could speak,
then this picture would sing.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.220
Priya.
- Yes.

01:05:01.868 --> 01:05:04.028
Let's leave Granny alone
with Grandpa for a while.

01:05:04.157 --> 01:05:05.565
Sure.
- Come.

01:05:16.795 --> 01:05:19.002
Was it necessary to pull
my leg in front of Grandma?

01:05:19.189 --> 01:05:22.749
I was not pulling your leg.
I was pulling your ear.

01:05:24.158 --> 01:05:27.718
I am sorry.
If you felt bad, I'm sorry.

01:05:30.724 --> 01:05:32.524
By the way, may I say something, Dev?

01:05:33.052 --> 01:05:35.212
The first time I met you...

01:05:35.436 --> 01:05:38.716
...I took you to be a crook.

01:05:39.995 --> 01:05:42.155
You don't have a heart in your chest.

01:05:42.515 --> 01:05:46.235
I used to see only darkness in you.

01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:49.166
But...

01:05:50.635 --> 01:05:52.355
But after coming here...

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:55.275
...and getting to know you...

01:05:56.636 --> 01:06:00.636
...I can see a flame
of goodness inside you...

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.315
...which is burning.

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:06.174
It is bright.

01:06:16.835 --> 01:06:19.115
A flame doesn't burn
on its own, Priya.

01:06:20.636 --> 01:06:22.556
There has to be someone to light it.

01:06:49.094 --> 01:06:58.254
"Life tolerates joy and sorrows,
but still she keeps quiet."

01:06:58.908 --> 01:07:08.148
"Up till now nobody has been able
to figure out the meaning of life."

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:17.780
"She tolerates joy and sorrows,
but still she keeps quiet."

01:07:18.348 --> 01:07:26.377
"Up till now nobody has been able
to figure out the meaning of life."

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:31.270
"Sometimes we're among our own
and sometimes we're among strangers."

01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:35.866
"Sometimes there are tears.
Sometimes, smiles."

01:07:36.066 --> 01:07:40.666
"Sometimes there is a river,
sometimes the desert."

01:07:40.946 --> 01:07:45.226
"It seems like it."

01:07:47.426 --> 01:07:56.626
"Life tolerates joy and sorrows,
but still she keeps quiet."

01:07:57.066 --> 01:08:07.666
"Up till now nobody has been able
to figure out the meaning of life."

01:08:31.586 --> 01:08:40.866
"Silence says softly that..."

01:08:41.265 --> 01:08:51.025
"...this life is God's prayer."

01:08:51.106 --> 01:09:00.106
"Nobody has ever
touched and seen it."

01:09:00.826 --> 01:09:09.786
"We have felt its fragrance.
It is a fragrant wind."

01:09:09.906 --> 01:09:18.906
"She tolerates joy and sorrows,
but still she keeps quiet."

01:09:19.586 --> 01:09:29.066
"Up till now nobody has been able
to figure out the meaning of life."

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:58.706
"Tell me from your heart.
Listen to the heart."

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:07.986
"Chose a partner for your heart."

01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:18.026
"The world will say anything.
Don't listen to the world."

01:10:18.466 --> 01:10:27.386
"Weave dreams of truth in your eyes."

01:10:27.506 --> 01:10:36.826
"Life tolerates joy and sorrows,
but still she keeps quiet."

01:10:37.226 --> 01:10:45.386
"Up till now nobody has been able
to figure out the meaning of life."

01:10:45.466 --> 01:10:50.226
"Sometimes we're among our own
and sometimes we're among strangers."

01:10:50.306 --> 01:10:54.986
"Sometimes there are tears.
Sometimes, smiles."

01:10:55.226 --> 01:10:59.586
"Sometimes there is a river,
sometimes a desert."

01:10:59.786 --> 01:11:04.626
"It seems like."

01:11:06.466 --> 01:11:11.143
"She tolerates joy and sorrows."
- "She tolerates joy and sorrows."

01:11:11.258 --> 01:11:16.058
"But still she keeps quiet."
- "But still she keeps quiet."

01:11:16.146 --> 01:11:20.963
"Till now nobody has known."
- "Till now nobody has known."

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:27.084
"What life..."
- "What life speaks?"

01:11:44.695 --> 01:11:46.815
It is time for you to leave, dear.

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:06.189
Don't be sad, Grandma.

01:12:07.429 --> 01:12:09.549
I will come back soon.

01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:15.669
Granny, if you came to my wedding...

01:12:16.245 --> 01:12:17.932
You know my dear...

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.587
...I don't leave this island.

01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:27.846
But my blessings
will be always with you.

01:12:29.842 --> 01:12:30.807
Granny.

01:12:33.494 --> 01:12:36.174
May God give you
every happiness in life.

01:12:37.336 --> 01:12:40.136
Give you your chosen life partner.

01:12:41.342 --> 01:12:43.502
Keep you away from every evil.

01:12:44.309 --> 01:12:46.229
Keep you away from every evil.

01:13:02.102 --> 01:13:04.022
Fill this vermilion...

01:13:05.439 --> 01:13:08.359
...in the parting of my
future daughter-in-law's hair.

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:16.217
See you my sweet
little baby boyfriend.

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:19.850
See you my beautiful
old girl boyfriend.

01:13:43.643 --> 01:13:47.843
Grandma, I don't feel
like leaving this place.

01:13:48.563 --> 01:13:51.083
Everything is so beautiful.

01:13:51.643 --> 01:13:53.283
So beautiful.

01:13:55.723 --> 01:13:58.643
Do you know why this
place is so beautiful, dear?

01:13:59.363 --> 01:14:01.963
We was designed from the heart.

01:14:03.166 --> 01:14:04.766
Here...

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:10.547
We had dreamt to make
our small world here.

01:14:11.556 --> 01:14:13.836
When we thought about it,
we thought it to be impossible.

01:14:14.389 --> 01:14:18.213
But my heart said that
this dream will be fulfilled.

01:14:20.068 --> 01:14:21.424
And it was fulfilled.

01:14:22.445 --> 01:14:24.325
Shall I tell you one thing, dear?

01:14:24.947 --> 01:14:28.067
This mind can confuse us.

01:14:28.684 --> 01:14:32.404
But the heart,
the heart never cheats.

01:14:33.156 --> 01:14:35.396
Always listen to your heart, dear.

01:14:35.892 --> 01:14:39.330
You will only achieve
happiness in life.

01:14:53.986 --> 01:14:54.986
Hey, you are standing here.

01:14:55.067 --> 01:14:56.947
I've been searching
the entire ship for you.

01:14:57.724 --> 01:14:59.684
Hey, you are crying.

01:15:00.244 --> 01:15:02.404
What is the matter, Priya?
What happened?

01:15:02.947 --> 01:15:04.080
Nothing.

01:15:04.808 --> 01:15:07.008
I won't be able to
today forget today ever.

01:15:07.431 --> 01:15:09.711
I have never felt
so much happiness before.

01:15:10.968 --> 01:15:13.968
So much love. So much closeness.

01:15:14.888 --> 01:15:17.528
I saw so much beauty
that tears came into my eyes.

01:15:19.608 --> 01:15:22.088
Thank you for giving me
a chance to meet your grandma.

01:15:22.848 --> 01:15:24.928
I should thank you.

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.928
You gave grandma so much love.

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:35.888
So tomorrow we'll be in Bombay.

01:15:37.248 --> 01:15:41.008
You will go your way
and I will go mine.

01:15:44.008 --> 01:15:46.008
Will you invite me to your wedding?

01:15:49.728 --> 01:15:50.968
I surely will.

01:15:51.237 --> 01:15:52.096
That...

01:15:53.528 --> 01:15:55.368
Let me know when
you're getting married.

01:15:55.488 --> 01:15:58.448
It hope we don't get
married on the same day.

01:15:58.743 --> 01:16:01.103
We won't be able to attend
each other's wedding in that case.

01:16:03.048 --> 01:16:05.528
We will surely attend
each other's wedding.

01:16:11.408 --> 01:16:13.368
Where will you go for your honeymoon?

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:15.928
Wherever you go.

01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:22.095
Don't do this.

01:16:22.279 --> 01:16:25.759
Otherwise your wife will
think that you are following me.

01:16:27.328 --> 01:16:29.688
You followed me that
day on the island.

01:16:34.088 --> 01:16:35.688
Why did you follow me, Priya?

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:40.408
Answer me, Priya.

01:16:46.606 --> 01:16:47.674
Tell me.

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:00.377
Priya.

01:17:06.012 --> 01:17:10.132
I'll wake up tomorrow and
it won't be like this never existed.

01:17:11.616 --> 01:17:14.816
I want to make this moment
the most important one of my life.

01:17:19.528 --> 01:17:21.488
I want to make you mine, Priya.

01:17:23.008 --> 01:17:24.928
Right now. At this moment.

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.288
In the middle of the sea.

01:17:29.677 --> 01:17:31.597
The moon and the
stars will bear witness.

01:17:31.862 --> 01:17:34.382
The waves of the sea will bless us.

01:17:35.158 --> 01:17:37.158
There will be nothing for miles...

01:17:37.429 --> 01:17:39.749
...except the emotions of 2 lovers.

01:17:40.533 --> 01:17:42.133
Their infinite love.

01:18:14.012 --> 01:18:15.412
No.

01:18:16.452 --> 01:18:17.812
No.

01:18:18.646 --> 01:18:20.074
No.

01:19:10.809 --> 01:19:12.209
Listen to me, Priya.

01:19:12.529 --> 01:19:14.289
I want to tell you something.

01:19:14.409 --> 01:19:15.809
I don't want to talk to you.

01:19:16.009 --> 01:19:17.329
Two minutes, Priya.

01:19:17.649 --> 01:19:18.929
Only two minutes.

01:19:27.769 --> 01:19:29.649
You have only two minutes.

01:19:30.009 --> 01:19:31.609
Tell me what you have to say.

01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:38.301
I love you, Priya.

01:19:40.649 --> 01:19:43.969
And I know that you love me.

01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:46.729
Who are you to decide for me?

01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:52.489
I am going to get married
to him and I have to love only him.

01:19:52.809 --> 01:19:53.769
You have got your answer.

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.689
Now please, leave. Leave.

01:19:58.889 --> 01:20:03.169
Priya, I know I'm not
worthy of your love right now.

01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:06.609
I have got nothing
to give you except my love.

01:20:06.929 --> 01:20:08.649
But give me a chance, Priya.

01:20:08.889 --> 01:20:12.569
I will abandon my comforts
and my cavalier attitude.

01:20:12.849 --> 01:20:14.209
Give six months, Priya.

01:20:14.369 --> 01:20:17.929
I will establish myself and
make myself eligible for your love.

01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:21.529
I will build a small house for you.
And I will love you a lot, Priya.

01:20:21.809 --> 01:20:24.369
I will give you
an abundance of happiness.

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:25.729
But just give me five months Priya.

01:20:25.903 --> 01:20:27.608
Which six months you
are talking about, Dev?

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:30.049
I am going to get married
to him next month.

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.524
Look.

01:20:34.009 --> 01:20:37.369
Your 2 minutes are over.
Now please go away from here.

01:20:37.489 --> 01:20:40.129
And for God's sake leave me alone.

01:20:41.415 --> 01:20:42.655
I will go.

01:20:42.889 --> 01:20:46.232
I will leave not just this room, but
I will go away from your life forever.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:49.817
Just place your hand on my head once
and tell me that you don't love me.

01:20:51.609 --> 01:20:53.289
Swear on it, and break my illusion.

01:21:04.889 --> 01:21:06.289
Please, Dev.

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.729
Try to understand.

01:21:10.409 --> 01:21:12.249
It is impossible.

01:21:12.729 --> 01:21:14.849
I am greatly indebted to him.

01:21:14.969 --> 01:21:17.089
I cannot cheat him.

01:21:17.413 --> 01:21:19.693
I cannot leave him.

01:21:21.279 --> 01:21:24.079
Don't increase my
problems further, Dev.

01:21:24.889 --> 01:21:26.409
Go away.

01:21:27.329 --> 01:21:28.809
Go away from here.

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:42.849
And take this with you.

01:21:43.409 --> 01:21:45.969
I don't want to keep
anything with me...

01:21:47.129 --> 01:21:48.809
...which will remind me of you.

01:21:55.756 --> 01:21:58.489
Priya, I will wait for
you tomorrow morning on the deck.

01:21:59.769 --> 01:22:01.809
If you come wearing this dress...

01:22:02.369 --> 01:22:04.609
...I will consider
your answer to be a yes.

01:22:05.369 --> 01:22:09.329
And if you're not wearing it,
I won't stop you.

01:22:09.648 --> 01:22:12.217
There is no need to wait
till the morning because my answer...

01:22:12.298 --> 01:22:13.858
Think about it before
you decide to answer.

01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:18.450
This is not a question
about two lives, but four.

01:22:19.777 --> 01:22:21.097
I will wait for you.

01:22:23.369 --> 01:22:25.449
There is no need to
wait till the morning...

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:27.250
...because my answer is no.

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:28.489
It is no.

01:22:28.609 --> 01:22:29.701
It is no.

01:22:50.089 --> 01:22:54.849
'I cannot dream of
living without you.'

01:22:56.426 --> 01:22:59.426
'Maybe I can live without
breathing for a few moments...'

01:23:00.051 --> 01:23:01.931
'...but I can't live without you.'

01:23:03.089 --> 01:23:05.685
'You, yes you are
the first girl whom...'

01:23:05.766 --> 01:23:08.326
'...I started loving
more than my life.'

01:23:09.569 --> 01:23:11.489
'My today, my tomorrow...'

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:15.250
'...my days,
my moments are all with you.'

01:23:15.769 --> 01:23:18.049
'Only you are be there
in my prayers...'

01:23:18.489 --> 01:23:23.049
'...my silence and in my speech.
Only you.'

01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:28.329
'Stars will fade,
the moon will grow dim...'

01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:34.009
'...time will wait here,
but till the last glimmer of hope...'

01:23:34.282 --> 01:23:37.282
'...till my last breathe,
I will wait for you.'

01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:40.169
'I will wait for you.'

01:23:40.929 --> 01:23:46.369
'Yes, Priya, I will wait for you.'

01:24:49.936 --> 01:24:50.936
I hate you.

01:24:53.496 --> 01:24:56.456
Are you happy that you got your way.

01:24:56.656 --> 01:24:57.646
Yes.

01:25:01.336 --> 01:25:03.096
I thinking about it all night.

01:25:03.416 --> 01:25:05.376
What my answer should be.

01:25:06.736 --> 01:25:09.416
My mind said that
the answer should be no.

01:25:10.536 --> 01:25:13.776
But then I heard Grandma's voice.

01:25:15.096 --> 01:25:18.136
It said do what your heart says.

01:25:21.576 --> 01:25:23.536
And my heart says that...

01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:28.936
...that I love you.

01:25:36.336 --> 01:25:38.336
One day you told me Priya...

01:25:38.736 --> 01:25:41.136
...that it is very easy
to break someone's trust.

01:25:41.816 --> 01:25:43.496
It is hard to sustain that trust.

01:25:45.176 --> 01:25:47.816
Today I swear on your love, that...

01:25:48.896 --> 01:25:54.016
...I will sustain
the trust at any cost.

01:25:55.056 --> 01:25:56.496
At any cost.

01:25:58.456 --> 01:25:59.536
All right.

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.496
Today is 14th August.

01:26:03.136 --> 01:26:07.016
We will meet exactly six months
from today on the 14th of February.

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:10.410
You mean, on Valentine's day?
- Yes.

01:26:11.216 --> 01:26:14.376
The day when lovers meet.

01:26:15.601 --> 01:26:17.761
All right. But where?

01:26:20.641 --> 01:26:21.681
There.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.530
On the Gateway of India.

01:26:23.841 --> 01:26:26.401
Exactly at 5 o' clock in the evening.

01:26:27.738 --> 01:26:29.458
I will wait for you.

01:26:29.945 --> 01:26:32.145
Yes, but...

01:26:33.496 --> 01:26:37.016
...we won't meet each
other for 6 months.

01:26:38.329 --> 01:26:41.889
And secondly of one of us...

01:26:42.056 --> 01:26:45.376
...may not come that day.

01:26:45.753 --> 01:26:47.433
The other won't question him.

01:26:47.616 --> 01:26:48.936
Don't say like that, Priya.

01:26:49.449 --> 01:26:50.929
We'll both be there.

01:26:53.048 --> 01:26:54.568
We will certainly come.

01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.090
Take care.

01:27:00.056 --> 01:27:01.656
Take care.

01:27:08.376 --> 01:27:10.136
Did you say anything?
- No.

01:27:11.945 --> 01:27:14.425
Do you like children?

01:27:14.736 --> 01:27:15.826
What?

01:27:16.576 --> 01:27:19.696
Yes, I like children very much.

01:27:26.016 --> 01:27:27.376
I will miss you, Dev.

01:27:28.016 --> 01:27:29.296
I will miss you too.

01:27:43.056 --> 01:27:44.496
Sister-in-law, Dev is about to come.

01:27:44.576 --> 01:27:46.496
You just don't worry.
His ship has arrived.

01:27:46.576 --> 01:27:47.959
Dev, hi!
- Welcome.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.760
The ship arrive from Singapore.

01:27:50.413 --> 01:27:51.213
Thank you.

01:27:51.536 --> 01:27:54.216
Dev, I missed you so much.

01:27:55.256 --> 01:27:56.576
Look at you. Poor baby.

01:27:56.656 --> 01:27:58.176
What have you done to yourself?

01:27:58.376 --> 01:28:00.536
What has happened to you?
You look like a Romeo.

01:28:00.616 --> 01:28:03.056
But no problem,
from now I will always stay with you.

01:28:04.336 --> 01:28:06.176
Listen, I am talking to you.

01:28:06.256 --> 01:28:09.776
Now look, we will always stay
together now. I love you so much, Dev.

01:28:15.376 --> 01:28:16.496
Why are you looking there?

01:28:16.616 --> 01:28:19.296
I am standing here, right
in front of you, in flesh and blood.

01:28:19.616 --> 01:28:22.696
Actually, I want to...
- And this dress.

01:28:22.896 --> 01:28:24.536
Whom are you impressing
with this dress?

01:28:24.696 --> 01:28:26.096
You've already impressed me.

01:28:27.857 --> 01:28:28.881
I missed you.

01:28:29.976 --> 01:28:31.456
I really missed you, Priya.

01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.430
Come, let's go.

01:28:49.331 --> 01:28:52.401
Hello, this is Anita Singhania.
Give call to dev.

01:28:52.572 --> 01:28:54.596
Yes, this is Dev speaking.

01:28:54.772 --> 01:28:56.212
Sorry. This is Nattu speaking.

01:28:56.292 --> 01:28:57.947
Where is Dev?
- Dev is there.

01:28:58.028 --> 01:28:59.748
Dev, attend the call.

01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:03.291
Hello, he is not here.
- What?

01:29:03.372 --> 01:29:05.252
No, I mean he is here,
but he is in the bathroom right now.

01:29:05.332 --> 01:29:06.852
He has been in the
bathroom for 2 hours.

01:29:06.932 --> 01:29:09.812
Actually, he went to the
toilet first and then the bathroom.

01:29:09.972 --> 01:29:11.132
Then he had to go the toilet again.

01:29:11.212 --> 01:29:12.532
So he had to go to
the bathroom again.

01:29:12.612 --> 01:29:13.412
That's toilet...
- Shut up.

01:29:13.493 --> 01:29:14.333
Shut up?

01:29:15.958 --> 01:29:18.558
Dev, why aren't you
taking Anita's call?

01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:20.869
And how much more will you smoke?

01:29:21.015 --> 01:29:24.072
Looking at all this smoke, someone
will think that there is a fire.

01:29:28.767 --> 01:29:30.167
There is a fire, Nattu.

01:29:31.726 --> 01:29:36.351
I met a girl in the ship and...

01:29:36.432 --> 01:29:38.705
And I love her very much.
I cannot live without her.

01:29:38.786 --> 01:29:40.626
And with this we end
our news bulletin. Bye-bye.

01:29:40.894 --> 01:29:42.869
No, Nattu. It is not like
that this time. Try to understand...

01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.790
I don't want to listen.
I don't want to listen to anything.

01:29:44.909 --> 01:29:48.349
Think about your bankruptcy
instead of a girl.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.600
Dev, I am not joking.

01:29:52.797 --> 01:29:56.252
The debtors have sent you
love letters. A legal notice.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.800
If you don't pay them
off in 10 days...

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.520
...then this bungalow that car,
this swimming pool that swing...

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.680
...even my trousers
will be auctioned.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.120
Sir.
- What is it?

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.840
Seth Hirachand has come to meet you.

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:09.360
Let him go to hell. Seth Hirachand.

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.680
Make him sit.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.240
He is the messenger of death.

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.280
He will go only after taking my life.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.360
You are dead, Nattu.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.080
Which God shall I pray to now?

01:30:18.161 --> 01:30:20.041
Who will save me?

01:30:22.170 --> 01:30:23.026
Hello.

01:30:24.306 --> 01:30:25.626
Why have you come here?

01:30:25.707 --> 01:30:28.547
I mean to say,
I was about to come to meet you.

01:30:28.628 --> 01:30:31.348
Then why take the
trouble to come here?

01:30:32.419 --> 01:30:33.416
Pain.

01:30:33.925 --> 01:30:37.285
We're in pain, Mr. Dev.

01:30:38.097 --> 01:30:39.257
It is true.

01:30:39.388 --> 01:30:41.948
How did we dare send you send a
notice to a billionaire's son-in-law.

01:30:42.029 --> 01:30:44.229
Pratap Rai Singhania's son-in-law.

01:30:44.437 --> 01:30:46.637
Exactly. Exactly.

01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:50.409
Rascals, how did you
dare you set foot here?

01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:51.969
All right, now since you have come.

01:30:52.128 --> 01:30:55.448
I will throw
your money on your faces.

01:30:55.529 --> 01:30:58.489
Listen. Listen.
- We made a mistake.

01:30:58.569 --> 01:31:00.289
A mistake.

01:31:00.495 --> 01:31:02.615
Say that you are a donkey.
- You are a donkey.

01:31:02.815 --> 01:31:04.615
Say, I am donkey.
- I am a donkey.

01:31:04.735 --> 01:31:06.415
Yes, say that you
are the greatest fool.

01:31:06.535 --> 01:31:07.775
You are the greatest fool.

01:31:07.855 --> 01:31:09.335
Say, I am the greatest fool.

01:31:09.495 --> 01:31:11.255
I am the greatest fool.
- Yes.

01:31:15.255 --> 01:31:17.655
Where has this problem come from?

01:31:17.895 --> 01:31:20.495
Hello, sister-in-law.
Hello, sister-in-law.

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.135
To hell with hello, where is Dev?

01:31:22.224 --> 01:31:23.824
He is not at home.
No, I mean, he is in the toilet.

01:31:23.935 --> 01:31:25.935
No, he's in the bathroom. No, he was
in the toilet, he's in the bathroom now.

01:31:26.015 --> 01:31:26.495
Now he has gone to the swimming
pool to catch fishes.

01:31:26.575 --> 01:31:27.096
Shut up.

01:31:27.177 --> 01:31:28.577
Sister-in-law.
- Idiot.

01:31:28.735 --> 01:31:29.935
Sister-in-law.

01:31:30.455 --> 01:31:31.495
No problem. No problem.

01:31:31.575 --> 01:31:33.175
She's doing it affectionately.

01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:34.268
What's it to you?

01:31:34.349 --> 01:31:35.909
Get out. Out.
- Nothing. I am going.

01:31:36.015 --> 01:31:37.455
Out.
- We are going.

01:31:37.655 --> 01:31:40.575
Dev, I've been calling
for the last two hours.

01:31:40.768 --> 01:31:43.408
You are not answering
any of my calls.

01:31:43.615 --> 01:31:45.095
What's wrong with, my darling?

01:31:45.615 --> 01:31:46.541
Anita.

01:31:48.775 --> 01:31:50.135
Anita, I want to tell you something.

01:31:50.216 --> 01:31:52.016
All that later. First, come with me.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.399
Okay.
- But Anita, listen to me...

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.416
No ifs and buts.
We are going. That's it.

01:31:55.497 --> 01:31:58.337
Yes, yes.
Let's go, otherwise we are gone.

01:31:58.530 --> 01:31:59.970
Sister-in-law, will be unhappy.

01:32:00.144 --> 01:32:02.024
Come. Come.

01:32:13.921 --> 01:32:15.241
Come on, Dev.

01:32:15.912 --> 01:32:17.272
Where have you brought me, Anita?

01:32:17.394 --> 01:32:18.682
Come with me.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.760
Anita, tell me, what is all this?

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:30.200
Come with me. You will know
everything in some time, come.

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:41.070
Welcome, my son-in-law. Welcome.

01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:43.430
Welcome to my house.
- What is all this, Anita?

01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:46.776
I will tell you, son-in-law.
How do you find this house?

01:32:52.163 --> 01:32:54.363
Like a palace.
- From today this is your house.

01:32:55.079 --> 01:32:58.359
A small gift from our side.
- A small gift!

01:32:59.370 --> 01:33:00.290
Thank you.

01:33:00.483 --> 01:33:01.683
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:01.890 --> 01:33:03.130
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.010
The owner of this house
didn't want to sell it...

01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:09.050
...but my daughter said
that she likes only this house.

01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:13.290
I ended up paying him
thrice as much for it.

01:33:13.435 --> 01:33:15.915
Money can buy anything, my boy.
Anything.

01:33:16.026 --> 01:33:17.946
You are right, sir.
- Excuse me, sir.

01:33:18.107 --> 01:33:19.827
The camera is ready.
- Come darling.

01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:22.509
Where?
- We will announce our wedding...

01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:24.310
...in front of the whole world on TV.

01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:25.244
What?
- Yes.

01:33:25.325 --> 01:33:26.965
I want to show
the entire world that...

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.880
...everyone's darling,
the most handsome Dev is only mine.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.800
All rights reserved. Let's go.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.640
But Anita.
- Come on. Go, go, go, go my boy.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.000
Sir, you are not a man.
- What?

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.439
You are a great man. A great man.

01:33:39.519 --> 01:33:41.519
You are great, sir.
- I know. I know.

01:33:41.599 --> 01:33:42.479
Come, come. Sit here.

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.640
Sir, please sit here.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.080
Sit here. Please sit here.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.280
What a pair.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.920
May no one cast an evil eye. Camera.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.160
Rolling.

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.440
Hello.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.360
Friends, we invite you to Moon TV's
super-hit Closedown meetings.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.200
And today we have with us,
Pratap Rai's future son-in-law...

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.480
...Mr. Dev Karan Singh and
his fiancée Anita Singhania.

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.800
Sister, see who is coming on TV?
- Who is it?

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.200
The one who has made
a record in love affairs.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.200
That Dev Karan Singh. Wow.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.520
So Mr. Dev,
you have decided to get married.

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:20.399
Yes.

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:23.658
But your image is
that of a flirtatious bumble bee...

01:34:23.786 --> 01:34:28.026
...who wanders from one flower
to another, then why suddenly this.

01:34:30.195 --> 01:34:32.995
Suddenly, I found a flower,
which filled my life...

01:34:33.906 --> 01:34:37.626
...with the fragrance of love.

01:34:39.432 --> 01:34:41.832
And your pockets with
billions of rupees?

01:34:42.393 --> 01:34:43.113
Oh, no.

01:34:43.233 --> 01:34:44.433
No, all right.

01:34:44.593 --> 01:34:46.113
Right now Mr. Singhania has said...

01:34:46.193 --> 01:34:48.633
...that he has given
you this small palace.

01:34:49.033 --> 01:34:51.113
He has given it,
but I have not accepted it.

01:34:52.073 --> 01:34:54.393
My wife will live in
a house that I can afford.

01:34:56.353 --> 01:34:58.353
So you are planning to work.

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:04.193
Mr. Dev will you tell the world,
what you are going to do?

01:35:04.313 --> 01:35:05.353
Painting.

01:35:05.873 --> 01:35:09.673
Not painting, Mr. Dev. Printing.
Printing.

01:35:09.801 --> 01:35:13.001
You will have to print Rs. 500.

01:35:13.193 --> 01:35:17.473
Because even Mr. Singhania
dog's drink packaged water.

01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:19.513
I can see that.

01:35:22.869 --> 01:35:23.761
Good joke.

01:35:23.842 --> 01:35:26.082
He sorted him out with that answer.

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:28.601
When have you decided
to start working, Dev?

01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:29.810
Daddy's here.

01:35:30.443 --> 01:35:31.443
No, Anita.

01:35:32.321 --> 01:35:34.481
Till now I have lived of others...

01:35:34.937 --> 01:35:37.457
...but she taught
me to love for others.

01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:42.098
And I'd like her to live
in a house filled with love...

01:35:42.513 --> 01:35:44.553
...and decorated with peace.

01:35:44.979 --> 01:35:47.099
Where children laugh
and there will be light.

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.620
Where happiness will
come without knocking.

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:54.270
Her? Are we not talking about her?

01:35:54.839 --> 01:35:58.319
Mr. Dev you want to
say that your future wife...

01:35:58.439 --> 01:36:00.999
...is not Miss Anita Singhania,
but someone else.

01:36:04.719 --> 01:36:10.279
Mr. Dev, I am asking you if Miss
Anita Singhania is your future wife?

01:36:12.279 --> 01:36:14.679
Oh, no, she is someone else.
- What?

01:36:14.959 --> 01:36:16.679
Swear on my mother, it's good that...

01:36:16.839 --> 01:36:18.519
...he's not marrying the witch.

01:36:18.599 --> 01:36:20.239
You can't do this to me.
- Disaster.

01:36:20.399 --> 01:36:22.279
Disaster. It is amazing.

01:36:22.359 --> 01:36:24.518
Ladies and gentleman,
the meeting today...

01:36:24.599 --> 01:36:25.959
...has taken an amazing turn.

01:36:26.039 --> 01:36:29.759
Mr. Dev Karan Singh.
Who has always liked to shock...

01:36:29.839 --> 01:36:30.879
...the world has shocked us again.

01:36:30.959 --> 01:36:33.919
He had declined...

01:36:34.119 --> 01:36:37.319
...Singhania's wealth,
his palace and his daughter.

01:36:37.469 --> 01:36:39.109
He done with it all.
- You idiot.

01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:40.638
What nonsense is this?
- Keep calm.

01:36:40.719 --> 01:36:43.118
Switch it off.
- He wants to cut his nose...

01:36:43.199 --> 01:36:45.199
...make a pickle out of
it and feed it to the dogs.

01:36:50.639 --> 01:36:51.958
Get out of here.
- Sorry, sir.

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.319
Get out, Dev.

01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:55.119
Dev, what is happening?

01:36:55.318 --> 01:36:57.278
Have you gone mad?
What is this nonsense?

01:36:57.421 --> 01:36:59.261
Are you drunk?

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:00.493
Oh, no.

01:37:00.685 --> 01:37:02.365
I am completely sober.

01:37:03.279 --> 01:37:06.252
Anita, I cannot marry you.
- Daddy.

01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:10.430
Daddy, I got my wedding gown,
shoes, clothes...

01:37:10.518 --> 01:37:11.998
...and picked out something
for the honeymoon..

01:37:12.079 --> 01:37:13.759
..and he says that he won't marry me.

01:37:13.839 --> 01:37:15.159
Yes daughter, but look.

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.079
Mr. Singhania, he will.

01:37:17.159 --> 01:37:18.919
He will. Sir, he is joking.
He is fooling you, sir.

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.439
No, Nattu, I am not joking.

01:37:20.639 --> 01:37:22.491
Anita, you will get
a better boy than me.

01:37:22.572 --> 01:37:24.046
You don't need to advice.

01:37:24.127 --> 01:37:25.359
I am telling you, get out from here.

01:37:25.479 --> 01:37:27.039
You get out from here.
Get out, I say.

01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:27.959
Come Nattu.
- Dev.

01:37:28.158 --> 01:37:30.046
Come daughter.
- Uncle, uncle. Uncle, trust me.

01:37:30.127 --> 01:37:31.438
He is a child.
I will make him understand, uncle.

01:37:31.572 --> 01:37:33.072
Please. Don't be angry.
- Turn around a little.

01:37:33.159 --> 01:37:34.079
I have turned around, sir.

01:37:34.239 --> 01:37:35.679
Bend a little.
- I have bent down, sir.

01:37:35.879 --> 01:37:36.799
Here.

01:37:41.479 --> 01:37:43.399
He is beating me.
- Come, Nattu.

01:37:55.948 --> 01:37:59.188
I had thought that there
is no real love in this world.

01:38:00.028 --> 01:38:04.228
But you've proved that
real love is alive even today.

01:38:04.908 --> 01:38:07.548
It's alive for people like you...

01:38:08.188 --> 01:38:10.908
...who sacrifice everything for love.

01:38:12.708 --> 01:38:15.228
What you have done is right.

01:38:16.948 --> 01:38:18.988
We don't know each other.

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:23.158
But I trust...

01:38:23.868 --> 01:38:26.348
...you will reach your goal.

01:38:27.965 --> 01:38:28.877
All the best.

01:38:42.893 --> 01:38:45.853
You don't worry. I will go.

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:48.533
I will deal with these people.

01:39:04.293 --> 01:39:06.133
What is the matter, brother?

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:09.133
Give me the keys.

01:39:11.013 --> 01:39:13.733
Take off your clothes.
- Hey, I won't take of my clothes.

01:39:14.053 --> 01:39:16.217
I will take off my clothes.
I will take everything off.

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:22.919
Now leave this.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.120
Shall I go?
- One minute.

01:39:24.201 --> 01:39:25.721
Say you are a donkey.
- You are a donkey.

01:39:25.802 --> 01:39:28.162
Say that I am a donkey.
- Yes, I am a donkey.

01:39:28.248 --> 01:39:30.279
Say, you are the greatest fool.
- You are the greatest fool.

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:32.759
Oh yes, I am the greatest fool.
- I am cow dung.

01:39:32.848 --> 01:39:35.048
I am the son of a dog. I will leave.

01:39:35.128 --> 01:39:36.488
Hey, wait, wait.

01:39:36.568 --> 01:39:38.232
Wait.
- The fatso.

01:39:45.608 --> 01:39:48.328
Dev, congratulations.
Congratulations.

01:39:48.489 --> 01:39:50.649
You have turned life around.

01:39:50.848 --> 01:39:53.768
One minute we were loaded,
and the next we're flat broke.

01:39:54.048 --> 01:39:57.448
Dev, we have nothing with us.
We are robbed.

01:39:57.697 --> 01:39:59.377
We are ruined.

01:40:00.808 --> 01:40:02.408
We are ruined.

01:40:02.608 --> 01:40:05.008
Don't cry dear. Take this penny.

01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:06.369
Have some snacks.

01:40:06.568 --> 01:40:09.474
God will make everything right.
- Alms.

01:40:10.079 --> 01:40:11.075
Dev.

01:40:11.257 --> 01:40:14.357
See this. I am promoted.

01:40:14.493 --> 01:40:18.173
I have become a beggar
from a bankrupt. A beggar.

01:40:18.553 --> 01:40:22.433
Do you know why?
Because you are in love.

01:40:22.567 --> 01:40:28.068
History bears witness
that love triumphs.

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:31.329
Farhaad, created rivers of milk.

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.040
And his mind curdled to curd.
- What's wrong with him?

01:40:34.121 --> 01:40:39.641
That Majnu, son of a cobbler,
was beaten with a shoe.

01:40:39.888 --> 01:40:44.048
And that Romeo,
scoundrel died the death of a dog.

01:40:45.338 --> 01:40:48.258
But for the first time...

01:40:48.441 --> 01:40:54.761
...some lover's love has
turned his friend into a beggar.

01:40:55.721 --> 01:40:58.361
May he be bitten by a black snake.

01:41:00.296 --> 01:41:05.056
Let love's corpse be
lifted and affection buried.

01:41:05.288 --> 01:41:08.888
Pour some petrol on love and burn it.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.160
Mannu. Mannu.

01:41:12.263 --> 01:41:17.388
There is someone just as mad as us.
- He is not as insane as us.

01:41:17.768 --> 01:41:21.154
No problem, he is even more insane.
Let's do one thing.

01:41:21.235 --> 01:41:23.675
We will catch him and
take him to our Lunatic asylum.

01:41:23.847 --> 01:41:26.127
Our asylum will become more
prestigious with his presence.

01:41:26.208 --> 01:41:27.474
Yes, yes. Let's go.
- Yes.

01:41:27.555 --> 01:41:29.915
If you love, there is only fear.

01:41:29.996 --> 01:41:32.036
Love should have never happen.

01:41:32.117 --> 01:41:34.877
The heart is a fool. It is mad.

01:41:34.968 --> 01:41:36.648
It is stupid. Stupid.

01:41:36.785 --> 01:41:37.945
Who is it?
- I have caught you.

01:41:38.026 --> 01:41:39.706
Caught you.
- What are you doing?

01:41:39.787 --> 01:41:41.971
Where are you taking me?
- Lunatic asylum.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.560
But I am not mad.

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:45.513
Dear, every mad person
speaks like this.

01:41:45.594 --> 01:41:46.314
Shut up.

01:41:46.395 --> 01:41:48.715
If you want to catch a mad person,
catch him.

01:41:48.929 --> 01:41:51.929
Do you know he has refused
billions of rupees...

01:41:52.112 --> 01:41:55.750
...because he is madly in love.
- Don't listen to this madman.

01:41:55.831 --> 01:41:57.751
Don't listen to this. Take him.

01:41:57.832 --> 01:41:59.952
Take him. He will be
prestigious of our asylum.

01:42:49.592 --> 01:42:51.672
What is happening?

01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:53.690
Why are you making such a noise?

01:42:54.882 --> 01:42:57.792
Mohan, listen. Tina.

01:43:00.793 --> 01:43:02.833
Hello. Please give the phone to Raj.

01:43:03.007 --> 01:43:04.727
He is not in the office, madam.

01:43:06.128 --> 01:43:08.512
If he comes, tell him I called.
- Priya?

01:43:08.632 --> 01:43:10.152
Yes, Priya.

01:43:10.308 --> 01:43:12.868
Tell him to call immediately.
I am at home.

01:43:12.949 --> 01:43:13.964
Yes, madam.

01:43:14.563 --> 01:43:16.643
Think of the devil
and the devil is here.

01:43:16.843 --> 01:43:18.643
Your servant is right
in front of you.

01:43:18.723 --> 01:43:20.613
Raj, where were you? I have to
talk to you about something important.

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.574
I also want to talk
about something important.

01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:25.335
I am such a donkey,
a great fool, and an idiot.

01:43:25.483 --> 01:43:27.843
Since last two years I
have been promising you marriage.

01:43:27.924 --> 01:43:30.244
Next month. But today.

01:43:31.243 --> 01:43:34.083
Today, suddenly met a crazy man.
What was his name?

01:43:34.170 --> 01:43:36.250
Yes, Dev Karan Singh.

01:43:36.745 --> 01:43:38.665
Yes, Dev Karan Singh.

01:43:38.817 --> 01:43:39.737
What a lover.

01:43:39.897 --> 01:43:41.777
What a terrific guy. Mind blowing.

01:43:41.922 --> 01:43:43.362
He has opened my eyes Priya.

01:43:43.458 --> 01:43:48.778
And I have decided to marry
you next week instead of next month.

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.540
No more business planning.

01:43:51.935 --> 01:43:53.495
Only family planning.

01:43:53.654 --> 01:43:54.933
Come on. Let's dance.

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:00.820
Raj, I have to tell you something.

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.900
What can be more special than this?

01:44:08.326 --> 01:44:10.206
Raj, please sit down.

01:44:10.501 --> 01:44:11.355
Sit.

01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:23.180
Raj, I was on the ship and...

01:44:23.614 --> 01:44:24.504
And what?

01:44:25.450 --> 01:44:28.650
And...
- Congratulation, my son.

01:44:29.465 --> 01:44:31.665
Hi, uncle Raghu.
- Live a long life, dear.

01:44:31.989 --> 01:44:33.669
Congratulations, Priya.

01:44:33.749 --> 01:44:35.469
This fool informed us over the phone.

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:38.109
My feel as though my life is complete
because you are getting married.

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:40.469
And my nephew didn't waste any time.

01:44:40.549 --> 01:44:43.269
Kept the phone,
boarded the plane, took out the car...

01:44:43.349 --> 01:44:44.749
...and became bankrupt.

01:44:44.829 --> 01:44:46.069
You also.

01:44:46.429 --> 01:44:47.909
This jewellery, these bangles and...

01:44:47.989 --> 01:44:50.429
...these dress is
for our daughter-in-law.

01:44:50.509 --> 01:44:52.989
And the brother-in-law
of the groom is for free.

01:44:54.308 --> 01:44:56.428
Wow, Priya you are great.

01:44:56.509 --> 01:44:58.504
You've got him to marry you.

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.262
Do it now before my brother
changes his mind.

01:45:01.343 --> 01:45:02.903
Get engaged and married.

01:45:02.984 --> 01:45:04.424
Right?
- But with great grandeur.

01:45:04.505 --> 01:45:06.903
Yes.
- Song, dance and festivities.

01:45:07.118 --> 01:45:08.684
What do you think, uncle?

01:45:08.765 --> 01:45:09.965
Shall we start from tomorrow?

01:45:10.165 --> 01:45:11.375
Why tomorrow? Why not today?

01:45:11.456 --> 01:45:12.816
What you are going to do tomorrow,
do today.

01:45:12.897 --> 01:45:14.097
What you are going
to do today, do now.

01:45:14.178 --> 01:45:17.112
Time roles on. Why wait.

01:45:17.193 --> 01:45:21.753
Hello, Uncle.
- Live a long life, my dear.

01:45:21.989 --> 01:45:23.629
Drink forever.

01:45:33.486 --> 01:45:36.326
Thank you for taking
me out of that lunatic asylum.

01:45:36.589 --> 01:45:38.149
If I had stayed a few hours more...

01:45:38.269 --> 01:45:41.029
...then those crazy people
would driven me up the wall.

01:45:41.229 --> 01:45:43.149
Laughing. You are laughing.

01:45:43.269 --> 01:45:46.029
Do you know there was
a mad person among them?

01:45:46.509 --> 01:45:48.549
The whole night tried to tell him...

01:45:48.630 --> 01:45:51.270
...that this is my stomach,
not a drum.

01:45:51.469 --> 01:45:55.309
But still that rascal took
a stick and beat me the entire night.

01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:59.349
If this had continued,
this drum would have burst.

01:45:59.430 --> 01:46:01.030
You are laughing? Laugh.

01:46:01.309 --> 01:46:03.749
Laugh.
But you will cry after some time.

01:46:03.981 --> 01:46:06.901
You will cry when this
attack of love will pass.

01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:08.065
I am telling you.

01:46:08.157 --> 01:46:11.677
Let's catch Singhania's feet,
otherwise we will be left hungry.

01:46:12.349 --> 01:46:14.389
Wanted Painter.

01:46:15.141 --> 01:46:16.941
Come Nattu. Our work is done.

01:46:17.157 --> 01:46:19.901
Wow.
- Excuse me.

01:46:20.502 --> 01:46:21.502
What is it?

01:46:21.583 --> 01:46:22.943
Look, maybe you need a painter.
I am a painter.

01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:24.541
I am a painter.
Tell me, what has to be painted.

01:46:24.622 --> 01:46:26.342
Yes, speed breaker,
speed breaker on the street.

01:46:26.423 --> 01:46:27.503
What? Speed breaker.

01:46:27.584 --> 01:46:29.304
Lines of black and white, understand.

01:46:29.385 --> 01:46:31.105
Hey, shall I slap you?

01:46:31.349 --> 01:46:33.109
You are telling a great painter like
Dev Karan...

01:46:33.190 --> 01:46:34.597
...to paint a speed breaker.

01:46:34.678 --> 01:46:35.669
Nattu, what are you talking?
- Old man...

01:46:35.749 --> 01:46:36.749
...you will fall into your grave...

01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:38.188
...if I blow.
- Nattu, enough.

01:46:38.269 --> 01:46:42.829
Look, sir, curse me,
but don't tell me about my health.

01:46:43.069 --> 01:46:46.949
I am very touchy regarding health.

01:46:47.069 --> 01:46:49.909
If I touch you, you will crumble.
- Nattu, enough.

01:46:50.254 --> 01:46:51.094
Look...

01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:52.690
Yes. All right.
- ...don't mind him.

01:46:52.784 --> 01:46:54.135
I am ready to paint.

01:46:54.263 --> 01:46:57.303
Then pick this can and start.
- Thank you.

01:46:58.503 --> 01:46:59.503
Come.

01:47:01.496 --> 01:47:03.656
If I hit you,
you will run around in circles.

01:47:19.829 --> 01:47:20.429
Hey.
- Yes.

01:47:20.549 --> 01:47:22.029
Why are you painting speed breakers?

01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:23.629
What are you doing
painting speed breakers?

01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:25.548
I mean, are you in love?

01:47:25.628 --> 01:47:27.748
Nowadays all lovers
are painting speed breakers.

01:47:27.829 --> 01:47:29.500
I thought you might
be in love that's...

01:47:29.581 --> 01:47:30.805
...why you are painting
speed breakers.

01:47:30.886 --> 01:47:33.085
That's not it. I'm earning a living.

01:47:33.166 --> 01:47:34.686
Give me a cigarette.
- Then take this.

01:47:34.767 --> 01:47:36.287
So shall I go search for matches.
- Go and search.

01:47:36.413 --> 01:47:38.253
I will go and search.
- These people.

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:44.836
100, 200, 300, 350.
Here are your wages for today.

01:47:51.667 --> 01:47:54.258
See Nattu, my first pay.

01:47:55.794 --> 01:47:56.874
I will buy a canvas with it.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.320
And I will buy some fried snacks.
- Nattu.

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.360
I am very hungry, friend.

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.110
Go.

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.080
Come, painter. Warm food is ready.

01:48:06.161 --> 01:48:07.032
Come.

01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.640
It's great to eat
a meal after two days.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.280
Eat it my dear.
Don't tell me, if it becomes cold.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:20.720
You eat. I will eat later.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.414
Shall I say one thing?

01:48:31.955 --> 01:48:33.835
That girl is probably
really amazing...

01:48:34.145 --> 01:48:36.825
...who changed a devil like you.

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:41.640
Tell me friend,
how does your Priya look?

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.640
How she talks? How does she laugh?

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.000
My Priya is very beautiful.

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:52.280
Like these colours.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.720
Pink eyes.

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.800
Golden voice.

01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.560
A smile like the
colours of the rainbow.

01:49:37.949 --> 01:49:45.669
"A lover should be the
one who ruins himself in love."

01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:50.670
"I will take a hundred births for you.
I will die for your love."

01:49:50.806 --> 01:49:54.886
"I will do something
that no lover has done."

01:49:55.182 --> 01:49:59.542
"I will take a hundred births for you.
I will die for your love."

01:49:59.623 --> 01:50:04.023
"I will do something
which no lover has done."

01:50:04.308 --> 01:50:12.144
"I have to tell you something."

01:50:13.069 --> 01:50:21.612
"I have to stay in your heart."

01:50:50.469 --> 01:50:54.109
"Come, let me give you love."

01:50:54.829 --> 01:50:57.909
"Give you the two worlds."

01:50:58.958 --> 01:51:07.878
"You are fairy,
an enchantress, a bud, shivering fog."

01:51:08.029 --> 01:51:14.191
"We will get intoxicated
in good weather."

01:51:14.367 --> 01:51:18.807
"We will have good weather."

01:51:19.029 --> 01:51:26.749
"I have to tell you something."

01:51:27.749 --> 01:51:35.549
"I have to stay in your heart."

01:51:36.150 --> 01:51:40.510
"I will take a hundred births for you.
I will die for your love."

01:51:40.749 --> 01:51:44.749
"I will do something
which no lover has done."

01:51:44.952 --> 01:51:49.192
"I will take a hundred births for you.
I will die for your love."

01:51:49.509 --> 01:51:53.789
"I will do something
that no lover has done."

01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:26.509
Dev. What did you do?

01:52:26.789 --> 01:52:28.198
Why? Isn't it good?

01:52:28.279 --> 01:52:30.919
Good? They are very good.
It is mind blowing.

01:52:31.037 --> 01:52:33.269
It is fantastic.
You have done magic, my friend.

01:52:33.389 --> 01:52:35.029
What a painting?!

01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:37.110
We will get whatever price we quote.

01:52:37.389 --> 01:52:38.749
And this one.

01:52:38.973 --> 01:52:41.733
It is beautiful. It's just beautiful.

01:52:41.814 --> 01:52:42.854
Is it complete now?

01:52:42.983 --> 01:52:46.663
Then complete it quickly, friend.
It will be auctioned. Auctioned.

01:52:46.744 --> 01:52:49.064
No, Nattu. I will never sell this.

01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:51.350
Why?
- This is for Priya.

01:52:52.504 --> 01:52:56.024
Only Priya will understand
that this is not just a picture.

01:52:56.984 --> 01:52:59.904
It is sentiments. A moment.

01:53:02.033 --> 01:53:03.713
A picture of my life.

01:53:08.424 --> 01:53:11.744
"I have chosen.
I have chosen a girl."

01:53:11.945 --> 01:53:15.345
"I have chosen.
I have chosen a girl."

01:53:15.528 --> 01:53:19.808
"Her innocent face has
become fixed in my heart."

01:53:19.904 --> 01:53:21.144
"I have chosen."

01:53:22.064 --> 01:53:25.104
"I have chosen.
I have chosen a girl."

01:53:25.184 --> 01:53:28.784
"I have chosen.
I have chosen a girl."

01:53:29.424 --> 01:53:31.224
Priya! Priya! Why did you come here?

01:53:31.384 --> 01:53:32.824
Come on. Let's go and dance.

01:53:33.039 --> 01:53:35.959
Raj, I wanted to tell you something.

01:53:37.824 --> 01:53:38.904
I know, Priya.

01:53:40.424 --> 01:53:41.864
I know what you want to tell me.

01:53:42.864 --> 01:53:44.624
You know?
- Yes.

01:53:44.864 --> 01:53:48.384
I am surprised why it took you so
long to tell me what is in your heart.

01:53:48.584 --> 01:53:51.344
The wedding celebrations have started.
Are you mad?

01:53:51.581 --> 01:53:53.904
Don't you understand that
my happiness lies in yours.

01:53:56.584 --> 01:53:59.504
That's why without telling you,
I have invited them here.

01:53:59.917 --> 01:54:01.117
What?

01:54:02.184 --> 01:54:03.264
Look there.

01:54:07.691 --> 01:54:09.064
Hello.
- Congratulations.

01:54:09.144 --> 01:54:11.103
Priya, you've proved
to be very selfish.

01:54:11.183 --> 01:54:12.863
You have forgotten
us after you have met Raj.

01:54:12.943 --> 01:54:14.023
Or what?
- Or what?

01:54:14.104 --> 01:54:17.299
Raj came to the orphanage and
invited us for the wedding, isn't it?

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.705
Yes, Priya, I can never
forget the respect and honour...

01:54:20.786 --> 01:54:21.906
...Raj has given us.

01:54:22.184 --> 01:54:25.904
The way you have treated
people from the orphanage...

01:54:25.984 --> 01:54:27.664
What are you saying, Mrs. Patil?

01:54:27.864 --> 01:54:29.264
You are Priya's family.

01:54:29.504 --> 01:54:31.584
And Priya's family means my in-laws.

01:54:31.774 --> 01:54:33.983
And I can't get married
without the bride's family.

01:54:34.064 --> 01:54:36.064
Hey, you...

01:54:36.144 --> 01:54:38.720
...why are you missing a chance
to make your brother-in-law dance.

01:54:38.801 --> 01:54:43.502
Uncle. - Quickly take your
brother-in-law to the floor.

01:54:43.664 --> 01:54:46.584
Quickly.
- I am coming. I am coming.

01:54:48.424 --> 01:54:53.464
"Meets in dreams.
My girl meets me in my dreams."

01:54:58.824 --> 01:55:03.664
"Meets in dreams.
My girl meets me in my dreams."

01:55:03.944 --> 01:55:13.984
"My girl who stays covered
in the veil the whole day."

01:55:19.529 --> 01:55:21.583
Today I am very happy.
- "Meets in dreams."

01:55:21.664 --> 01:55:24.984
"He lives in my dreams."
- He respects you so much.

01:55:25.293 --> 01:55:27.213
He loves you so much.

01:55:27.533 --> 01:55:30.064
You are very lucky. Very.

01:55:30.184 --> 01:55:34.544
"He lives in my dreams."

01:55:34.844 --> 01:55:37.924
What is matter, dear?
Why are you crying?

01:55:38.518 --> 01:55:41.303
Aunt, I don't want to get married.

01:55:41.532 --> 01:55:42.332
What?

01:55:43.979 --> 01:55:45.504
What are you saying?

01:55:45.584 --> 01:55:46.824
Aunt...
- Come here. Come here.

01:55:46.904 --> 01:55:52.072
"Meets in dreams.
My girl meets me in my dreams."

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.388
"My girl who stays covered in
the veil the whole day in the eyes."

01:55:56.546 --> 01:56:01.426
"Meets in dreams.
My girl meets me in my dreams."

01:56:01.778 --> 01:56:07.080
"Meets in dreams.
My boy meets me in my dreams."

01:56:07.184 --> 01:56:12.504
"Meets in dreams.
My girl meets me in my dreams."

01:56:17.904 --> 01:56:22.224
Now tell me aunt, what should I do?
What should I do?

01:56:23.344 --> 01:56:24.983
Before taking any decisions...

01:56:25.063 --> 01:56:27.623
...you should meet your
childhood friend, Madhu.

01:56:27.704 --> 01:56:28.643
Madhu?

01:56:29.304 --> 01:56:31.064
But she is in Bangalore
with her husband.

01:56:31.145 --> 01:56:34.505
No, she has come back
to the orphanage forever.

01:57:06.664 --> 01:57:07.664
Madhu.

01:57:09.024 --> 01:57:11.624
Madhu. I am Priya.

01:57:12.864 --> 01:57:13.824
Priya.

01:57:13.944 --> 01:57:16.624
Yes, I am Priya.

01:57:20.252 --> 01:57:22.612
Aunt, what has happened to her?

01:57:22.784 --> 01:57:25.384
Someone saw her wandering
in Bangalore station.

01:57:25.574 --> 01:57:29.054
Reported to us. We went
and brought her to the orphanage.

01:57:29.254 --> 01:57:32.174
But her husband? Her in-laws?

01:57:32.304 --> 01:57:36.303
Her husband left
her for some other girl.

01:57:37.229 --> 01:57:41.909
The doctor says she has completely
lost her mental balance.

01:57:42.944 --> 01:57:46.184
She has even tried to
commit suicide many times.

01:57:47.096 --> 01:57:51.736
If you sacrifice
everything for somebody...

01:57:52.063 --> 01:57:54.143
...and suddenly
he comes and tell you...

01:57:54.232 --> 01:57:57.032
...that he's leaving you forever.

01:57:57.344 --> 01:57:59.784
That can make anyone crazy.

01:57:59.904 --> 01:58:02.184
Even you. Even Raj.

01:58:05.584 --> 01:58:06.624
Take her away.

01:58:09.414 --> 01:58:11.254
You want to break the wedding.

01:58:11.344 --> 01:58:13.464
But do you know the consequences?

01:58:13.624 --> 01:58:15.544
Will Raj be able to bear this shock?

01:58:16.744 --> 01:58:20.304
You want the same thing to
happen to Raj that Madhu went through.

01:58:22.064 --> 01:58:26.864
He should also die several
deaths thinking about you.

01:58:28.481 --> 01:58:32.201
Priya, I agree that
your joy lies in your love.

01:58:32.282 --> 01:58:34.762
But don't you think that...

01:58:35.264 --> 01:58:40.304
...it is duty to
sacrifice your love...

01:58:40.504 --> 01:58:42.864
...for the sake of Raj's happiness.

01:58:44.944 --> 01:58:47.024
Now you have to decide.

01:58:47.991 --> 01:58:52.271
Do you want to side
with love or duty?

01:58:54.021 --> 01:58:55.701
Remember one thing, dear.

01:58:57.344 --> 01:59:00.144
If you leave Raj...

01:59:01.344 --> 01:59:04.344
...no decent boy will...

01:59:04.624 --> 01:59:08.744
...dare marry a girl
from the orphanage.

01:59:10.944 --> 01:59:12.544
He won't dare.

01:59:20.986 --> 01:59:24.146
'Dear Dev, forgive me.'

01:59:24.521 --> 01:59:26.561
'Because I won't be
able to come to meet you...'

01:59:26.642 --> 01:59:28.734
'...as promised at the
Gateway on 14th of February.'

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:32.155
'Don't think that my
love for you has ended.'

01:59:32.418 --> 01:59:35.818
'But I won't be able to
pay Raj back my entire life.'

01:59:36.125 --> 01:59:38.725
'For a girl, her husband is God.'

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:42.045
'But I am going to
make my God my husband.'

01:59:42.325 --> 01:59:43.885
'Forgive me.'

01:59:53.125 --> 01:59:54.218
Dev.

01:59:55.253 --> 01:59:56.806
Dev.

01:59:58.684 --> 02:00:01.648
Dev. Dev.
- What happened?

02:00:01.774 --> 02:00:06.843
I have sold your woman, for 50,000.

02:00:06.959 --> 02:00:09.140
Is it? And what about the other one?

02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:11.301
I will sell her too.

02:00:11.601 --> 02:00:14.721
I will take a total of
Rs. 100,000 for that damsel.

02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:20.740
Shameless, rogue. Broker.

02:00:21.172 --> 02:00:22.892
Hey, why are you slapping him?

02:00:22.972 --> 02:00:25.257
People should break the
skull of a person like you...

02:00:25.361 --> 02:00:26.523
...and make skull park.

02:00:26.604 --> 02:00:27.984
Skull park.

02:00:28.086 --> 02:00:32.366
If you sell the woman again,
I will put all your teeth in your hand.

02:00:32.447 --> 02:00:35.108
Understand. Scoundrel. Rogue.

02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:37.852
Come, Sheru. He is ruined.
- You are...

02:00:38.937 --> 02:00:40.297
Why are you laughing?

02:00:40.844 --> 02:00:42.044
I am going home.

02:00:42.607 --> 02:00:43.767
All right, go.

02:00:46.437 --> 02:00:48.157
Why, friend, why are you staring?

02:00:48.357 --> 02:00:50.757
Selling woman means,
he has sold a picture of a woman.

02:00:50.997 --> 02:00:52.037
Picture.

02:00:52.117 --> 02:00:54.077
That means you are a painter.
- Yes.

02:00:54.157 --> 02:00:56.717
Then what are you doing here?
- Earning money.

02:00:56.797 --> 02:00:59.637
I paint paintings all night at home.
And paint hoarding all day here.

02:01:00.237 --> 02:01:01.237
When do you sleep?

02:01:02.383 --> 02:01:05.543
I was sleeping till now, friend.
But I have woken up now.

02:01:06.153 --> 02:01:08.393
Either you are mad or a lover.

02:01:08.651 --> 02:01:10.651
I am both. A mad lover.

02:01:11.789 --> 02:01:13.269
Now I understand.

02:01:26.164 --> 02:01:27.124
Raj.

02:01:28.151 --> 02:01:31.468
You are here so early in the morning.

02:01:31.773 --> 02:01:35.413
Not early, but at right time.
Come, sit here.

02:01:45.281 --> 02:01:49.441
Priya we will become husband
and wife in the next two days.

02:01:50.281 --> 02:01:51.881
We will be married to each other.

02:01:54.161 --> 02:01:58.881
I want no secrets between us.

02:01:59.681 --> 02:02:03.281
If we get to know about things later,
it may cause us pain.

02:02:06.475 --> 02:02:10.795
Now listen properly to
what I am going to tell you now.

02:02:15.761 --> 02:02:17.761
When you went to Singapore...

02:02:18.481 --> 02:02:22.201
...I met Maya in one
of the seminars in London.

02:02:23.341 --> 02:02:25.381
In the first meeting became friends.

02:02:27.367 --> 02:02:32.647
And I don't know when, but gradually
friendship developed into love.

02:02:36.204 --> 02:02:40.004
And when I felt it, I remembered you.

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:45.340
I said, I am going
to get married to you and...

02:02:47.627 --> 02:02:50.747
I told her to forget me forever.

02:02:54.165 --> 02:02:58.725
Hearing this,
Maya's heart broke. But...

02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:05.620
Priya, was what I did right?

02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:10.140
No, Raj, you didn't.

02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:14.180
If you love Maya then
you should go to her.

02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:15.900
You should carry on your love Raj...

02:03:15.981 --> 02:03:17.981
...because nothing
is greater than love.

02:03:18.062 --> 02:03:21.390
Then why are you coming to
marry me and turning down Dev's love?

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:25.880
Thank God, Dev doesn't
live at this address anymore.

02:03:25.961 --> 02:03:29.641
And this letter written by
you came into my hands otherwise...

02:03:30.968 --> 02:03:32.288
Are you mad Priya?

02:03:32.688 --> 02:03:35.128
The man who left the
entire world for you...

02:03:35.328 --> 02:03:37.208
...you are telling him to forget you.

02:03:37.728 --> 02:03:39.848
Why, Priya? Why? Why?

02:03:40.568 --> 02:03:43.248
Just because you think
that I have been good to you.

02:03:44.754 --> 02:03:47.354
I am sorry, Priya. I am sorry.

02:03:48.225 --> 02:03:50.265
Even though you regard me as God...

02:03:50.931 --> 02:03:52.771
...in reality you don't
even think of me as a friend.

02:03:52.852 --> 02:03:55.092
No, Raj, no. I...
- What no, I?

02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:57.621
Priya, friends never
bestow favours on friends.

02:03:57.702 --> 02:03:59.222
You have built this academy,
this house...

02:03:59.341 --> 02:04:02.181
...everything with your own ability.

02:04:02.703 --> 02:04:06.143
You have insulted your art,
your skills...

02:04:06.463 --> 02:04:08.023
...and even our friendship
by calling it a favour.

02:04:09.012 --> 02:04:12.452
Even if the world says
that you are bound by favours...

02:04:12.976 --> 02:04:14.976
...even then your goal is only Dev.

02:04:15.616 --> 02:04:17.776
Because really there
is nothing more than love.

02:04:21.273 --> 02:04:23.073
14th of February, right?

02:04:24.753 --> 02:04:27.153
You will surely go to meet
Dev on the 14th of February.

02:04:27.535 --> 02:04:31.255
You will certainly go.
And I will be bid farewell from here.

02:04:32.153 --> 02:04:33.093
Raj.

02:04:34.393 --> 02:04:35.433
I...

02:04:36.313 --> 02:04:37.913
I...

02:04:38.153 --> 02:04:40.913
Your favours...

02:05:04.484 --> 02:05:05.724
Wow.

02:05:06.968 --> 02:05:09.128
You made it, friend. You made it.

02:05:09.408 --> 02:05:13.048
See this. Your own, your own
house bought by your own earnings.

02:05:13.334 --> 02:05:16.454
It's unbelievable.
Friend, It's unbelievable.

02:05:17.688 --> 02:05:22.048
Today I have realised that
true love has great strength.

02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:25.150
I am proud of you, my friend.
I am proud of you, my friend.

02:05:25.527 --> 02:05:28.007
That's why, we have given
him the tile of The King of Lovers.

02:05:28.088 --> 02:05:31.728
Sir, do you recognise me?
No. Moon TV, N.D. Shrivastav.

02:05:31.936 --> 02:05:34.140
Interview.
Interview. Singhania's punch.

02:05:34.289 --> 02:05:36.390
Remember.
Remember. You remembered me now.

02:05:36.785 --> 02:05:39.345
Sorry. I need an interview from you.

02:05:39.505 --> 02:05:41.367
Look, I don't want to do all this.

02:05:41.447 --> 02:05:43.085
No, sir. Please, please.
Don't say no, sir.

02:05:43.166 --> 02:05:46.726
All the lovers in the world
look up to you as their idol.

02:05:46.857 --> 02:05:48.734
Tomorrow is the 14th of February,
Valentine's day.

02:05:48.815 --> 02:05:50.095
What is Valentine's day?

02:05:50.176 --> 02:05:53.656
It's the Id,
Diwali and Christmas for lovers?

02:05:53.825 --> 02:05:56.105
Sir, if you give a small
message on this auspicious day...

02:05:56.186 --> 02:05:57.445
...everyone will be happy sir.

02:05:57.526 --> 02:05:59.006
Sir, please, please.
- I am sorry.

02:05:59.210 --> 02:06:00.247
Hey, speak, speak.

02:06:00.328 --> 02:06:01.528
Move your hand.
- Sorry.

02:06:01.609 --> 02:06:04.729
Dev, give him the interview.
He will keep on speaking if you don't.

02:06:06.288 --> 02:06:06.999
Sir.

02:06:07.127 --> 02:06:08.207
All right,
ask me quickly what you want to ask.

02:06:08.288 --> 02:06:10.528
Thank you.
Thank you. Camera. Quick. Quick.

02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:12.169
Look, oh sorry.

02:06:12.368 --> 02:06:16.128
Look, consider the camera to
be on when the red light is glowing.

02:06:16.208 --> 02:06:19.088
The red light is glowing.
- Oh, yes. The red light.

02:06:19.168 --> 02:06:21.088
Thank you. Friends.

02:06:21.888 --> 02:06:26.048
Today on eve of Valentine's day,
we will make you meet...

02:06:26.248 --> 02:06:30.688
...the renowned Casanova,
who turned sincere.

02:06:31.088 --> 02:06:33.088
Mr. Dev Karan Singh.

02:06:34.459 --> 02:06:38.939
Mr. Dev you have achieved
your dreams in these six months.

02:06:39.306 --> 02:06:40.946
Now what do you want from life?

02:06:42.625 --> 02:06:44.585
Tomorrow we will become one forever.

02:06:45.415 --> 02:06:50.815
I just want her to
bring a lot of love for me.

02:06:52.172 --> 02:06:54.523
Even the shadow of sorrow
should stay away from us.

02:06:55.092 --> 02:06:56.412
Only happiness and happiness.

02:06:58.989 --> 02:07:02.749
And now Mr. Dev tell us
the name of that lucky girl...

02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:05.670
...who will be bringing
happiness to your life.

02:07:07.985 --> 02:07:11.185
The name of that
innocent girl is Priya.

02:07:13.875 --> 02:07:14.875
I love you, Priya.

02:07:17.532 --> 02:07:18.372
I love you.

02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:23.150
I love you too, Dev.

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:26.710
Wow, teacher said, I love you.

02:07:26.791 --> 02:07:29.468
So what? My papa also
says I love you every day.

02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:32.429
To your mother?
- No, to the aunt next door.

02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:33.374
Hey.

02:07:37.489 --> 02:07:39.489
Teacher, teacher, what is love?

02:07:39.665 --> 02:07:42.465
The thing which happens
to a 16-year-old girl...

02:07:42.713 --> 02:07:47.713
...when she sees a 17 year-old-boy.
That's known as love.

02:07:47.972 --> 02:07:50.772
Teacher, teacher,
make me 17 years old too.

02:07:50.923 --> 02:07:52.603
I want to love too.

02:07:53.278 --> 02:07:53.957
With whom?

02:07:54.118 --> 02:07:55.718
With Madhuri Dixit.

02:07:56.345 --> 02:08:00.065
Why? - Because
she dances very nicely.

02:08:01.278 --> 02:08:04.426
Shut up.
Teacher's heart is thumping today.

02:08:04.619 --> 02:08:08.299
Tomorrow is teacher's wonderful day,
isn't it, teacher?

02:08:09.083 --> 02:08:10.243
Yes, children.

02:08:10.723 --> 02:08:13.123
Tomorrow is the
biggest day of my life.

02:08:13.643 --> 02:08:16.883
Because tomorrow
I am going to meet my Dev.

02:08:18.283 --> 02:08:22.364
14th of February, here I come.

02:08:43.116 --> 02:08:47.876
"Tinak tin tana, play that tune?"

02:08:48.476 --> 02:08:51.476
"I dance dhinak dhin."

02:08:51.683 --> 02:08:56.403
"My heart sings and
the worlds dances too."

02:08:56.563 --> 02:09:01.243
"Tinak tin tana, play that tune?"

02:09:01.883 --> 02:09:04.883
"I dance dhinak dhin."

02:09:05.052 --> 02:09:10.092
"My heart sings and
the worlds dances too."

02:09:36.763 --> 02:09:41.483
"The anklets which tinkle call me."

02:09:42.092 --> 02:09:47.372
"A fragrant stole comes
fluttering in the breeze."

02:09:47.492 --> 02:09:52.452
"I will tell you the
things of my hearts."

02:09:52.883 --> 02:09:58.012
"How I have spent
these days and nights?"

02:09:58.124 --> 02:10:00.832
"In the mirror of my eyes."

02:10:00.913 --> 02:10:03.393
"In the garden of my memories."

02:10:03.614 --> 02:10:06.134
"In my breath and my life."

02:10:06.215 --> 02:10:08.735
"Is only your fragrance."

02:10:08.816 --> 02:10:11.325
"Is only your face."

02:10:11.583 --> 02:10:14.085
"Is only your discussion."

02:10:14.166 --> 02:10:16.766
"Is only your guard."

02:10:17.014 --> 02:10:21.774
"Tinak tin tana, play that tune?"

02:10:22.268 --> 02:10:25.308
"I dance dhinak dhin."

02:10:25.534 --> 02:10:30.614
"My heart sings and
the worlds dances too."

02:10:59.894 --> 02:11:04.774
"Now I don't want
to live without you."

02:11:05.239 --> 02:11:10.279
"Now I don't want to shed
the tears of estrangement."

02:11:10.614 --> 02:11:15.414
"I will keep you in my eyelids."

02:11:15.934 --> 02:11:20.894
"I will give you
true love every moment."

02:11:21.374 --> 02:11:23.854
"I will take you in my arms."

02:11:23.974 --> 02:11:29.174
"I will play with your hair.
I will take all your sorrows."

02:11:29.374 --> 02:11:31.974
"You are my darling."

02:11:32.054 --> 02:11:34.214
"You are my heartbeat."

02:11:34.774 --> 02:11:37.214
"You are my sweet heart."

02:11:37.364 --> 02:11:39.964
"You are my life partner."

02:11:40.134 --> 02:11:44.814
"Tinak tin tana, play that tune?"

02:11:45.439 --> 02:11:48.399
"I dance dhinak dhin."

02:11:48.694 --> 02:11:53.334
"My heart sings and
the worlds dances too."

02:11:53.414 --> 02:11:56.454
"I dance dhinak dhin."

02:11:56.574 --> 02:12:00.974
"My heart sings and
the worlds dances too."

02:12:01.454 --> 02:12:04.454
"I dance dhinak dhin."

02:12:04.614 --> 02:12:09.574
"My heart sings and
the worlds dances too."

02:12:35.094 --> 02:12:37.054
What happened?
- I will just go and see, madam.

02:12:42.334 --> 02:12:44.412
What happened?
- Madam the tyre is punctured.

02:12:44.493 --> 02:12:45.731
I will just change it.
It will take just two minutes.

02:12:45.814 --> 02:12:47.454
No problem. It is nearby. I will go.

02:12:47.614 --> 02:12:48.934
Madam it will only take two minutes.
I will change it.

02:12:49.014 --> 02:12:51.454
No. It is nearby. I will go.
- All right, madam.

02:12:55.574 --> 02:12:58.054
What happened? What happened?

02:13:18.454 --> 02:13:19.214
Please Dr. Dastoor.

02:13:19.294 --> 02:13:20.774
Prepare for the operation.
- Yes, sir.

02:13:22.894 --> 02:13:25.774
Excuse me, where can I find Dr. Dastoor?
- There he is.

02:13:26.471 --> 02:13:27.853
About the operation...
- Absolutely.

02:13:27.934 --> 02:13:28.694
I am Raj.
- Yes.

02:13:29.014 --> 02:13:30.134
How is Priya? How is she?

02:13:30.214 --> 02:13:31.693
We have to perform a major
operation to save her life...

02:13:31.774 --> 02:13:34.734
Don't worry about money,
just save her doctor.

02:13:34.829 --> 02:13:37.189
Look, it is a matter of money,
Mr. Raj.

02:13:37.348 --> 02:13:39.668
We need your signatures
in this paper.

02:14:10.498 --> 02:14:13.237
Dev. I am coming.

02:14:13.663 --> 02:14:16.543
Wait for me, Dev. I...

02:14:18.392 --> 02:14:21.872
Take me back, dear. Take me back.

02:14:24.586 --> 02:14:25.706
This marriage.

02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:28.329
I am coming.

02:14:29.159 --> 02:14:30.439
Wait for me.

02:14:32.222 --> 02:14:33.448
Wait for me.

02:15:02.865 --> 02:15:03.993
Dev.

02:15:04.499 --> 02:15:07.499
Dev you are so late. Where is Priya?

02:15:09.289 --> 02:15:11.809
I am asking you. Dev. Where is Priya?

02:15:14.908 --> 02:15:15.828
She didn't come.

02:15:24.428 --> 02:15:25.743
She didn't come.

02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:04.820
Priya. Priya, you should take rest.

02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.560
No, Dev is waiting for me Raj.
I have to go.

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.960
Keep still, please.
- No, Raj.

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:11.120
Dev is waiting for me Raj.
Let me go Raj. I have to go.

02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.350
You cannot go anywhere now.
- Why can't I go? I am fine Raj.

02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:14.686
Let me go. Dev is waiting for me Raj.

02:16:14.767 --> 02:16:18.207
Priya, listen to me, please.
- Why don't you understand? Let me go.

02:17:25.025 --> 02:17:26.065
Priya.

02:17:29.602 --> 02:17:30.531
Priya, you...

02:17:35.627 --> 02:17:36.454
Priya.

02:17:42.156 --> 02:17:46.276
Dev. Does Dev know about it?

02:17:47.299 --> 02:17:48.339
No, Priya.

02:17:51.637 --> 02:17:55.317
He shouldn't come
to know at any cost, Raj.

02:17:55.656 --> 02:17:57.296
He won't come to know.

02:17:57.531 --> 02:18:00.051
I promise you. I promise you.

02:18:00.388 --> 02:18:02.948
Now relax.
- Thank you, Raj.

02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.600
All Dev's happiness, all his joys...

02:18:09.841 --> 02:18:12.641
...have ended Raj.

02:18:13.117 --> 02:18:15.357
Everything has ended.

02:18:49.012 --> 02:18:50.052
Dev.

02:18:53.754 --> 02:18:54.994
Grandma.

02:19:57.785 --> 02:20:01.785
"In a moment it makes me laugh."

02:20:02.869 --> 02:20:06.549
"In a moment it makes me cry."

02:20:07.789 --> 02:20:16.709
"No matter what punishment
this life gives."

02:20:17.909 --> 02:20:26.509
"Why doesn't the one who goes far,
come back?"

02:20:27.869 --> 02:20:36.669
"Someone tell me
why does this happen?"

02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:49.880
Grandma.

02:20:50.607 --> 02:20:51.767
Grandma.

02:21:13.977 --> 02:21:18.857
Dev dear,
forgive me, we couldn't wait for you.

02:21:19.173 --> 02:21:22.453
Because it would take four
to five days for you to come.

02:21:23.336 --> 02:21:25.816
No problem. I understand.

02:21:26.157 --> 02:21:27.237
Dev dear...

02:21:27.334 --> 02:21:31.294
...it was Grandma's last wish to have
these anklets sent to Priya madam.

02:22:00.959 --> 02:22:06.279
"We will be successful.
We will be successful."

02:22:06.459 --> 02:22:10.278
"We will be successful, one day."

02:22:10.518 --> 02:22:11.638
Did you see Priya?

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:13.620
How happy are
the children to see you!

02:22:13.701 --> 02:22:15.941
Thank you, Raj, for everything.
- Come on.

02:22:16.212 --> 02:22:17.812
Friends don't do any favours.

02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:21.450
You take care. Bye.
- "We will be successful, one day."

02:22:22.982 --> 02:22:28.460
"We will be successful.
We will be successful."

02:22:28.541 --> 02:22:33.301
"We will be successful, one day."

02:22:33.754 --> 02:22:39.420
"We have belief in our heart.
We have total belief."

02:22:39.501 --> 02:22:43.461
"We will be successful, one day."

02:22:45.507 --> 02:22:46.867
Teacher, what time is it?

02:22:48.138 --> 02:22:50.162
Sunny is singing the wrong lyrics.

02:22:50.243 --> 02:22:52.379
Sing, hope is on your mind.

02:22:52.459 --> 02:22:53.819
What does mind mean?

02:22:53.941 --> 02:22:59.381
It's a place where
feelings are hidden.

02:22:59.896 --> 02:23:03.258
We hide a lot of love in there...

02:23:03.435 --> 02:23:05.714
...for our mummy, our papa.

02:23:05.795 --> 02:23:09.419
But you don't have parents,
so is your heart empty?

02:23:15.299 --> 02:23:16.379
No, dear.

02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:18.530
There is someone else.

02:23:19.633 --> 02:23:21.953
Whose love I have hidden in my heart.

02:23:22.259 --> 02:23:23.899
Who is that someone?

02:23:28.045 --> 02:23:31.405
There is a prince.
A very adorable prince.

02:23:32.858 --> 02:23:36.218
Prince. A prince like the
one in the tale of Cinderella.

02:23:38.418 --> 02:23:39.938
Yes, absolutely like that.

02:23:40.098 --> 02:23:41.618
All right, so you are Cinderella.

02:23:41.818 --> 02:23:46.378
Then in the end you will eat,
drink and be merry forever.

02:23:46.532 --> 02:23:48.092
If God wishes.

02:23:49.553 --> 02:23:52.810
No, teacher you won't
live happily forever.

02:23:52.939 --> 02:23:53.724
Why?

02:23:53.858 --> 02:23:57.498
But how will the
prince recognise you...

02:23:57.578 --> 02:23:59.538
...when he will bring your lost shoe?

02:23:59.618 --> 02:24:00.938
You don't even have legs.

02:24:08.904 --> 02:24:10.744
Stupid boy.
You have hurt the teacher.

02:24:10.824 --> 02:24:13.584
I am sorry, teacher. I have hurt you.

02:24:15.245 --> 02:24:17.925
No, Jay. You are right.

02:24:20.365 --> 02:24:22.525
I will never get my prince.

02:24:22.783 --> 02:24:25.863
No, no, you will get him.
You will surely get your prince.

02:24:25.944 --> 02:24:27.504
We all will pray.

02:24:38.094 --> 02:24:43.414
"We will be successful.
We will be successful."

02:24:43.511 --> 02:24:47.551
"We will be successful, one day."

02:24:48.714 --> 02:24:54.346
"We have belief in our heart.
We have total belief."

02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:58.429
"We will be successful, one day."

02:25:11.831 --> 02:25:14.619
Hello.
- Dev sir, this is Jaspal speaking.

02:25:14.831 --> 02:25:18.057
No, no, not Jaspal Bhatti,
Jaspal Sandhu, your agent.

02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:19.240
Yes, tell me, Jaspal.

02:25:19.321 --> 02:25:24.455
One of your paintings,
Mann, a girl wants to buy it.

02:25:24.737 --> 02:25:27.577
You know that that painting
is not for sale, Jaspal.

02:25:27.657 --> 02:25:31.737
Sir, I explained it to her,
but she's insisting.

02:25:31.818 --> 02:25:35.298
She is sitting and
praising the painting.

02:25:35.497 --> 02:25:39.777
She says, this is not a painting.
It is moment.

02:25:39.858 --> 02:25:42.218
I don't know,
she said it's a relationship.

02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:43.977
And I don't know,
what she was saying.

02:25:44.137 --> 02:25:46.697
Yes, it is the picture
of someone's love.

02:25:48.777 --> 02:25:49.557
Who is this girl?

02:25:49.638 --> 02:25:53.238
I don't know. It is some lame girl.

02:25:55.497 --> 02:25:58.537
I think,
she doesn't even have much money.

02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:01.360
I will do this,
I will quote a high price.

02:26:01.526 --> 02:26:03.926
She will run as soon as she
hears the price of the painting.

02:26:04.008 --> 02:26:04.979
No.

02:26:06.229 --> 02:26:07.149
Give her the painting.

02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:09.069
Give her. For how much?

02:26:09.378 --> 02:26:11.346
No, don't take money from her.
Just give it away.

02:26:11.427 --> 02:26:12.907
For free?
- Yes.

02:26:14.138 --> 02:26:17.178
And tell her the painter
has said thank you.

02:26:19.858 --> 02:26:22.778
At least there is someone who understands
the emotions hidden in the painting.

02:26:23.036 --> 02:26:26.756
All right. As you wish. Okay.

02:26:34.706 --> 02:26:37.546
Dev. See this.
See, what is in my hand.

02:26:37.746 --> 02:26:39.186
Two tickets of a super hit drama.

02:26:39.266 --> 02:26:41.786
It is a drama which will
do away with all your problems.

02:26:41.906 --> 02:26:43.426
Come. Come.
Come. Come. Get ready quickly.

02:26:44.346 --> 02:26:46.506
No, I don't want to go.

02:26:46.906 --> 02:26:48.906
Is it? Then take, tear the tickets.

02:26:49.706 --> 02:26:52.260
Nattu.
- No, no, tear them. Who I am to you?

02:26:52.341 --> 02:26:54.465
Why will you come for me?
I am not your friend.

02:26:54.604 --> 02:26:58.385
I am your secretary,
your servant, your crony.

02:26:58.549 --> 02:27:00.545
You will not come to see a
drama with me even if it pleases me.

02:27:00.634 --> 02:27:03.025
Let friendship go to
hell and these tickets too.

02:27:17.586 --> 02:27:19.986
You will be happy if I went along?
- Very much.

02:27:20.786 --> 02:27:21.906
Then let's go.

02:27:22.026 --> 02:27:23.183
That is the spirit.

02:27:23.264 --> 02:27:25.904
Come. Let us get ready quickly.
We will go quickly.

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:34.041
Suraj, I know that it will
hurt if you hear what I have to say.

02:27:34.642 --> 02:27:38.042
But destiny has decided...

02:27:38.433 --> 02:27:41.673
...that we should
get estranged forever.

02:27:42.233 --> 02:27:43.993
Get separated for ever.

02:27:44.673 --> 02:27:49.033
Kiran, either you say
that you will never leave me...

02:27:49.113 --> 02:27:51.113
...or tell me that I should die.

02:27:51.233 --> 02:27:55.073
Because I cannot live for
a single moment without you.

02:27:55.193 --> 02:27:57.033
Why don't you understand, Suraj?

02:27:57.113 --> 02:27:59.633
Our union is impossible.

02:27:59.713 --> 02:28:01.073
But why?

02:28:01.313 --> 02:28:05.553
What is the problem, Kiran?
Is something lacking in my love?

02:28:05.633 --> 02:28:06.553
No.

02:28:06.633 --> 02:28:09.873
Then why do you want
to go away from me. Why?

02:28:10.018 --> 02:28:11.952
Don't ask me anything.

02:28:12.119 --> 02:28:14.912
It will pain you when I tell you
and it's painful for me to narrate.

02:28:14.993 --> 02:28:17.513
Forget that you have
ever loved someone.

02:28:18.113 --> 02:28:21.513
Forget that you ever
felt true love for someone.

02:28:21.753 --> 02:28:24.073
Forget me, Suraj. Forget me.

02:28:49.692 --> 02:28:55.372
"I have loved you.
I will love you always."

02:28:56.117 --> 02:29:01.397
"Even if I die,
the love in my heart won't lessen."

02:29:02.139 --> 02:29:08.219
"I shed tears when I remember you."

02:29:08.531 --> 02:29:15.091
"Every time they say,
that we will be united."

02:29:15.810 --> 02:29:21.610
"What is this life?
It is just your story."

02:29:22.143 --> 02:29:27.943
"It is just your story.
This life of mine."

02:29:28.133 --> 02:29:33.853
"I have loved you.
I will love you always."

02:29:34.470 --> 02:29:40.030
"Even if I die,
the love in my heart won't lessen."

02:30:06.565 --> 02:30:12.325
"Those talk of yours.
Those customs of affection."

02:30:12.958 --> 02:30:18.518
"Were the promises
and all were false?"

02:30:19.405 --> 02:30:25.085
"Darling, is it true.
Just tell me that."

02:30:26.245 --> 02:30:31.685
"The moment of love
should not break."

02:30:32.605 --> 02:30:37.685
"Give me some return of my waiting."

02:30:38.565 --> 02:30:44.445
"I have loved you.
I will love you always."

02:30:44.925 --> 02:30:50.645
"Even if I die,
the love in my heart won't lessen."

02:31:23.405 --> 02:31:26.125
"I am only yours."

02:31:26.205 --> 02:31:29.445
"Take whatever promise you want to."

02:31:29.725 --> 02:31:35.525
"Oh my darling,
give me your sorrows."

02:31:36.245 --> 02:31:41.485
"I will have to tolerate the
grief of separation my whole life."

02:31:43.045 --> 02:31:48.685
"My goal has been lost on the roads."

02:31:49.405 --> 02:31:54.525
"My problems will end only with me."

02:31:55.399 --> 02:32:01.159
"I have loved you.
I will love you always."

02:32:01.845 --> 02:32:07.405
"Even if I die,
the love in my heart won't lessen."

02:32:07.850 --> 02:32:13.970
"You are in front of me,
then why is this distance?"

02:32:14.285 --> 02:32:20.285
"How can I tell you my problem?"

02:32:21.403 --> 02:32:27.443
"Is this a life?
Only shedding tears."

02:32:27.855 --> 02:32:34.215
"Only shedding tears.
Is this a life?"

02:33:09.702 --> 02:33:11.182
What is the matter, Priya?

02:33:15.462 --> 02:33:17.188
Shall I bring you some water?
- No.

02:33:17.269 --> 02:33:18.160
Sure?

02:33:40.938 --> 02:33:41.789
Hello.

02:33:42.406 --> 02:33:43.211
Hello.

02:34:00.556 --> 02:34:01.796
Raj.

02:34:02.365 --> 02:34:04.594
Priya, I will tell
Dev everything, today.

02:34:04.675 --> 02:34:06.355
No, Raj.
You will do nothing of that sort.

02:34:06.436 --> 02:34:08.436
I am sorry, Priya.
I won't stay silent now.

02:34:08.607 --> 02:34:10.758
I will tell him the truth.
- No, Raj.

02:34:11.094 --> 02:34:13.313
Raj. Raj, please wait.

02:34:13.394 --> 02:34:14.797
For God's sake don't do this, Raj.

02:34:14.878 --> 02:34:17.586
Listen to me, Raj. Raj.

02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:19.620
For God's sake don't do this, Raj.

02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:22.280
Raj, please come back. Raj.

02:34:22.393 --> 02:34:24.433
Raj, listen to me, Raj,

02:34:27.367 --> 02:34:28.235
Priya.

02:34:31.009 --> 02:34:32.969
Priya, Priya are you
all right, Priya?

02:34:33.091 --> 02:34:35.811
You will never tell him.
You have taken an oath.

02:34:36.008 --> 02:34:37.977
You have taken an oath
on our friendship Raj.

02:34:38.058 --> 02:34:40.578
Please Raj. Please Raj.

02:34:51.954 --> 02:34:53.314
You are angry with me?

02:34:55.475 --> 02:34:56.438
Oh, no,

02:34:57.612 --> 02:34:58.550
I am fine.

02:35:00.114 --> 02:35:01.594
I am your friend.

02:35:02.714 --> 02:35:04.914
Your oath has silenced me.

02:35:05.427 --> 02:35:09.227
So now I am silent.
Now I don't want to argue on this.

02:35:09.474 --> 02:35:10.794
It's over and done.

02:35:13.274 --> 02:35:14.874
Shall I ask you one thing, Raj?

02:35:16.354 --> 02:35:18.834
May God forbid,
if this accident had happened to you...

02:35:19.074 --> 02:35:20.594
...what would you have done?

02:35:22.205 --> 02:35:25.125
Tell me,
Raj, what would you have done?

02:35:26.782 --> 02:35:28.182
You would have allowed
yourself to become...

02:35:28.262 --> 02:35:29.942
...a burden on someone?

02:35:32.641 --> 02:35:34.118
I know, Raj,

02:35:35.291 --> 02:35:37.157
you are upset with me.

02:35:39.649 --> 02:35:43.889
But no problem,
if not in this birth...

02:35:45.394 --> 02:35:47.594
...Dev and I will surely
meet in our next birth.

02:35:51.552 --> 02:35:54.952
The world is based on hope. Isn't it?

02:35:59.139 --> 02:36:02.459
Dev, all this.. Where are you going?

02:36:03.202 --> 02:36:05.682
Grandma's house.
- For how many days?

02:36:07.379 --> 02:36:09.059
Forever.
- What?

02:36:09.611 --> 02:36:11.071
Have you gone mad, Dev?

02:36:11.157 --> 02:36:14.117
A new life is inviting
you in and you...

02:36:14.596 --> 02:36:17.188
Dev, now you have
become a great artist.

02:36:17.269 --> 02:36:20.102
Well-known art critics don't
get tired of praising your art.

02:36:20.183 --> 02:36:22.743
Success is kissing your feet,
my friend and you...

02:36:22.974 --> 02:36:24.974
You are talking about leaving
everything and going away.

02:36:25.262 --> 02:36:28.182
Don't do this, friend. Don't do this.

02:36:31.766 --> 02:36:33.006
Nattu.

02:36:33.806 --> 02:36:36.166
When a man loses his eyes...

02:36:36.526 --> 02:36:39.366
...even the light of a thousand
lamps is useless for him.

02:36:40.851 --> 02:36:43.171
This fame, this name, this honour.

02:36:43.286 --> 02:36:45.806
This was just a way to reach my goal.

02:36:48.446 --> 02:36:50.486
And now that there is no goal...

02:36:51.446 --> 02:36:53.086
...what shall I do with the path.

02:36:59.783 --> 02:37:01.223
Take care of yourself.

02:37:32.866 --> 02:37:42.266
"Life tolerates joy and sorrows,
but still she keeps quiet."

02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:53.500
"Up until now no one had been
able to deduce the meaning of life."

02:37:56.759 --> 02:37:59.719
Very good. Very, very good.

02:37:59.879 --> 02:38:03.079
I believe that we will
get the first prize in...

02:38:03.159 --> 02:38:04.519
...the All India Musical Competition.

02:38:04.657 --> 02:38:08.257
Yes, but you won't come with
us to receive the first prize.

02:38:08.338 --> 02:38:10.978
Sister, do come.
We only have to go till Pune.

02:38:11.059 --> 02:38:15.094
I want to, but the doctor
had told me not to travel far.

02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:16.870
Teacher, I will look after you.

02:38:16.951 --> 02:38:18.789
You cannot look after yourself.

02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:21.430
You relieve yourself
in your underwear at your age.

02:38:21.563 --> 02:38:24.723
I do it my underwear and not yours.
You do your work.

02:38:26.403 --> 02:38:28.123
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

02:38:28.203 --> 02:38:31.555
Children, do you all want your
teachers condition to deteriorate?

02:38:31.636 --> 02:38:33.316
No.

02:38:33.525 --> 02:38:37.285
Then come back after
winning the first prize. Okay?

02:38:37.366 --> 02:38:38.886
Okay.
- All the best.

02:38:38.967 --> 02:38:40.687
Thank you teacher. Bye, bye.
- Come on, let's go.

02:38:40.768 --> 02:38:42.408
Bye, bye.
- Come one. Let's go.

02:38:42.489 --> 02:38:45.141
Come on, come on.
- Bye. Good luck.

02:38:45.501 --> 02:38:47.181
All the best.

02:38:48.061 --> 02:38:49.701
Happy Diwali, teacher.

02:38:50.461 --> 02:38:52.461
Happy Diwali, sweetheart.

02:38:57.189 --> 02:38:59.930
Do you want anything else, sister?
- No.

02:39:00.675 --> 02:39:03.355
Sister. Shall I say one thing?
- Yes.

02:39:03.774 --> 02:39:07.054
You are alone on Diwali day.
I don't like it.

02:39:07.374 --> 02:39:08.934
Come to our house.

02:39:09.014 --> 02:39:11.974
No, Sharda, I am fine. Thank you.

02:39:12.614 --> 02:39:15.054
All right. I will leave.
- Yes.

02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:21.430
Sister, if you need anything.
Then ring the bell and call me.

02:39:21.511 --> 02:39:23.511
Yes?
- Is this Priya Verma's...

02:39:25.891 --> 02:39:26.750
Dev?

02:39:27.509 --> 02:39:28.749
Hello, Priya.

02:39:29.958 --> 02:39:30.946
Hello, Dev.

02:39:33.024 --> 02:39:34.704
May I come in?

02:39:35.104 --> 02:39:37.744
Yes, come in, Dev.

02:39:48.032 --> 02:39:49.392
How are you, Dev?

02:39:50.192 --> 02:39:51.392
I am fine.

02:39:54.353 --> 02:39:58.033
May I sit?
- Yes, yes. Come, come, please.

02:40:05.227 --> 02:40:08.547
How are you?
- You have asked once.

02:40:09.707 --> 02:40:11.947
Well, how are you?

02:40:12.027 --> 02:40:15.187
I? I am fine. I am okay.

02:40:15.947 --> 02:40:17.667
Your face is saying something else.

02:40:18.387 --> 02:40:22.347
Yes, that.. I am not well.

02:40:22.507 --> 02:40:25.947
Maybe I have fever because
of the change in the weather.

02:40:28.347 --> 02:40:29.907
Don't worry.
I won't take much of your time.

02:40:29.988 --> 02:40:32.388
No, no it is not like that.

02:40:32.829 --> 02:40:36.269
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing here.

02:40:37.389 --> 02:40:42.038
Yes, I was.

02:40:42.119 --> 02:40:43.399
To say sorry.

02:40:43.578 --> 02:40:45.938
Sorry? For what?

02:40:46.274 --> 02:40:47.874
For not keeping my promise.

02:40:48.624 --> 02:40:51.904
I didn't come to meet
you that day at the Gateway.

02:40:53.474 --> 02:40:54.754
You didn't come there?

02:40:55.173 --> 02:40:58.693
Yes, that's why,
even though it's a bit late...

02:40:59.211 --> 02:41:01.091
...it's necessary
for me to say sorry.

02:41:01.821 --> 02:41:04.941
So here I am and I am sorry Priya.

02:41:05.933 --> 02:41:07.453
I am really sorry.

02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:09.630
It's okay, Dev. It's okay.

02:41:09.711 --> 02:41:11.951
No, it's not okay, Priya.
It's not okay.

02:41:12.083 --> 02:41:16.043
What I did was very wrong.
To break a promise means...

02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:19.989
You might have felt
very bad that day.

02:41:21.339 --> 02:41:23.979
Yes, I have felt bad.

02:41:24.789 --> 02:41:29.869
I thought, what is this?
To make someone wait like this.

02:41:30.062 --> 02:41:31.902
And that also till late at night.

02:41:32.822 --> 02:41:34.622
By the way, how long did you wait?

02:41:34.742 --> 02:41:37.782
I mean to say you must
have waited long. Isn't it?

02:41:37.982 --> 02:41:40.222
Yes, I waited long.

02:41:40.583 --> 02:41:44.183
Around 12, 1 O'clock...

02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:45.742
Till morning 5 O' clock.

02:41:48.884 --> 02:41:50.084
Till morning 5 O' clock.

02:41:50.165 --> 02:41:51.565
What did you do after that?

02:41:54.453 --> 02:41:56.693
I was very angry.

02:41:57.235 --> 02:42:00.595
To be waiting alone at the
Gateway till 5 in the morning...

02:42:00.795 --> 02:42:02.835
...with a car decorated
with flowers...

02:42:02.995 --> 02:42:04.835
...and all the
arrangements for marriage.

02:42:05.915 --> 02:42:07.875
Look everywhere like crazy.

02:42:07.995 --> 02:42:10.355
Is she there?
Or is she standing there?

02:42:11.235 --> 02:42:14.395
She will come.
Will she arrive with stubbornness.

02:42:17.188 --> 02:42:20.068
Truly, Priya. It was very bad.

02:42:22.075 --> 02:42:23.675
Shouldn't have behaved like this.

02:42:26.180 --> 02:42:30.820
At least a letter explaining
why you weren't there.

02:42:31.413 --> 02:42:34.533
Maybe she didn't know which
address to the send the letter to?

02:42:36.610 --> 02:42:38.410
It's not so difficult
to find an address?

02:42:38.770 --> 02:42:41.850
Now see. I found you
by searching your address.

02:42:42.050 --> 02:42:44.010
You can even find God,
if you search for him.

02:42:44.370 --> 02:42:48.010
You find everything.
Except for one thing.

02:42:49.570 --> 02:42:50.850
True love.

02:42:51.963 --> 02:42:53.523
You will also get true love, Dev.

02:42:53.604 --> 02:42:55.564
That means your love was false?

02:42:55.852 --> 02:42:57.727
Why didn't you come, Priya?
Why didn't you come?

02:42:57.808 --> 02:42:59.888
You have promised that you will come.
- Dev, please.

02:43:00.052 --> 02:43:02.012
We have also decided
that is if one cannot come...

02:43:02.093 --> 02:43:04.493
...then the other won't ask questions.
- I know why you didn't come.

02:43:04.652 --> 02:43:06.212
Because there wasn't
any true love in your heart.

02:43:06.332 --> 02:43:08.532
Why are you asking questions,
if you know the answer?

02:43:16.612 --> 02:43:18.572
It is easy to win someone's trust.

02:43:19.132 --> 02:43:20.892
It is even easier to break it.

02:43:22.597 --> 02:43:24.437
But it is hard to carry the trust.

02:43:25.766 --> 02:43:27.286
You have said so to me, right?

02:43:30.326 --> 02:43:31.606
I can't believe that...

02:43:32.166 --> 02:43:35.766
...the very person who has
advised me to sustain trust...

02:43:36.966 --> 02:43:40.166
...has broken my trust today.

02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:44.240
Well.

02:43:45.344 --> 02:43:47.664
Leave love,
you didn't even carry your friendship.

02:43:48.823 --> 02:43:50.663
You didn't invite me to your wedding.

02:43:51.939 --> 02:43:53.659
I will invite you,
when it's confirmed.

02:43:54.829 --> 02:43:57.657
You mean your wedding is still...

02:43:57.738 --> 02:44:00.418
Forget about me. Talk about yourself.

02:44:00.671 --> 02:44:02.231
What is happening in your life?

02:44:02.575 --> 02:44:04.735
I have heard that you
have become a great painter.

02:44:05.784 --> 02:44:10.024
Yes. And this also proves
difficult for me sometimes.

02:44:10.516 --> 02:44:11.756
What difficulties?

02:44:11.996 --> 02:44:15.756
People see me and say that
there goes the crazy painter...

02:44:16.116 --> 02:44:18.436
...who says I love you to every girl.

02:44:18.516 --> 02:44:20.236
He says, where will you
meet me after six months?

02:44:21.626 --> 02:44:23.866
And the girls come to meet you.
- Of course they do.

02:44:24.236 --> 02:44:27.396
Everywhere.
Taj Mahal. Red Fort. Charminar.

02:44:29.036 --> 02:44:32.156
This crazy person calls them at
different places and makes them wait.

02:44:32.596 --> 02:44:34.076
And what does he do himself?

02:44:36.270 --> 02:44:37.328
Wait.

02:44:38.231 --> 02:44:39.631
Waiting for someone else.

02:44:40.243 --> 02:44:42.683
Dev, why do you want
to ruin your life?

02:44:43.338 --> 02:44:45.418
You will surely get some good girl.

02:44:46.116 --> 02:44:49.956
Don't worry, Priya.
I have chosen my life partner.

02:44:51.196 --> 02:44:52.436
My memories.

02:44:54.316 --> 02:44:58.036
And today I am leaving
this city forever with them.

02:45:03.849 --> 02:45:05.209
Oh, I forgot.

02:45:07.739 --> 02:45:11.379
I wish you a Happy Diwali.
- No, Dev. I can't take this gift.

02:45:12.126 --> 02:45:14.686
This is not from me.
This is Grandma's gift.

02:45:15.766 --> 02:45:17.883
Her last wish for me
to bring these anklets to you.

02:45:27.306 --> 02:45:29.306
That's why I didn't get
the answer to my letters.

02:45:37.019 --> 02:45:38.739
No, no. I will wear them myself.

02:45:42.798 --> 02:45:45.798
Don't worry, Priya. I know my limits.

02:45:57.609 --> 02:45:58.809
Good bye, Priya.

02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:01.110
Good bye, Dev.

02:46:21.485 --> 02:46:25.885
Do you know Priya.
I painted a picture.

02:46:27.085 --> 02:46:28.605
You and Grandma.

02:46:29.765 --> 02:46:31.885
Do you remember that
moment of love when...

02:46:31.966 --> 02:46:35.566
...Grandma had told you that
she will send you these anklets.

02:46:37.125 --> 02:46:39.405
I had imprisoned that
moment in a picture.

02:46:41.805 --> 02:46:45.885
My friend Nattu used to
say that that is my best painting.

02:46:47.245 --> 02:46:50.605
And I had decided that
I will never sell that painting.

02:46:52.005 --> 02:46:55.285
But last week my manager
called me and told me that...

02:46:55.765 --> 02:46:57.405
A girl has come to the showroom.

02:46:57.485 --> 02:46:59.365
Who has liked the painting a lot.

02:47:01.405 --> 02:47:05.765
She saw such details
in that painting...

02:47:07.125 --> 02:47:09.885
...which I had always
wanted you to see.

02:47:11.517 --> 02:47:14.637
I told my manger to
give that painting to her.

02:47:14.821 --> 02:47:17.301
Because she didn't have money
and that poor girl was lame...

02:47:17.781 --> 02:47:19.501
'No, no. I will wear them myself.'

02:47:32.706 --> 02:47:35.626
Do you know Priya what she
said when she saw that picture?

02:47:36.423 --> 02:47:39.703
She said, this is not only a picture,
it a moment.

02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:41.223
A feeling.

02:47:42.102 --> 02:47:43.582
It is the picture of some love.

02:48:30.703 --> 02:48:32.703
Don't stare at me like this, Dev.

02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:36.120
Don't stare at me like this.

02:48:54.889 --> 02:48:56.649
Why did you hide this from me?

02:48:58.154 --> 02:48:59.394
Why didn't you tell me?

02:49:02.907 --> 02:49:04.947
Why didn't it happen to me,
if it has to happen?

02:49:08.428 --> 02:49:09.588
No, Dev.

02:49:10.618 --> 02:49:12.378
It was my fault.

02:49:12.628 --> 02:49:15.268
I was running to meet you.

02:49:16.101 --> 02:49:17.541
When I opened my eyes...

02:49:18.747 --> 02:49:20.707
...there was no land beneath my feet.

02:49:22.342 --> 02:49:24.262
I have lost my feet, Dev.

02:49:26.735 --> 02:49:28.815
I am not like you anymore, Dev.

02:49:29.694 --> 02:49:31.574
I am not like you.

02:49:31.655 --> 02:49:32.735
Yes...

02:49:33.775 --> 02:49:35.815
...you have become very selfish.

02:49:37.248 --> 02:49:40.208
You wanted to take all the
problems all the difficulties.

02:49:42.615 --> 02:49:44.455
I only asked for some happiness.

02:49:46.263 --> 02:49:48.263
You didn't even give me your sorrow.

02:49:50.895 --> 02:49:52.455
I hate you, Priya.

02:49:54.015 --> 02:49:54.946
I hate you.

02:50:00.739 --> 02:50:01.859
Priya.

02:50:02.483 --> 02:50:04.443
Don't leave me again now.

02:50:05.751 --> 02:50:08.311
We will laugh and face
all our difficulties.

02:50:14.743 --> 02:50:16.228
You know, dev.

02:50:17.728 --> 02:50:20.790
All that happens, happens for good.

02:50:22.657 --> 02:50:26.134
If you will come
home late after marriage..

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:29.064
..then I won't beat you.

02:50:47.729 --> 02:50:48.929
All the best, Dev.

02:50:49.129 --> 02:50:50.569
God bless both of you.

02:50:51.886 --> 02:50:54.446
Now the bride and groom
stand up for the rounds.
